a2dp.Vol,Negative,"Review 1: The app worked great  but.... ... it defeated the ability of my other BT devices to auto-connect. The hassle of manually connecting wasn't worth it. Uninstalled and all devices automatically connect again. Reply with a fix and I will reinstall and give it 5 stars.

Review 2: Should be basic Android functionality Now when bluetooth connects to my car I can hear it without fiddling with the volume and accepting the silly message  for the thousandth time  about loud volumes being dangerous for headphone use.

Review 3: Wtf  developer... I installed this app because it didn't work more than a year ago  and you didn't delete ANY of the registry files off of my phone. What a sad app.

Review 4: Interferes with bluetooth Interferes with my basis peak blue tooth and blocks it talking to my s7 edge.... Then does not exit but restarts at once. Uninstall.

Review 5: Failed to fix my problem with volume being reduced after connecting via Bluetooth  and in fact muted the audio instead.

Review 6: Poor Does not work on Bluetooth headset or through vehicle audio

Review 7: Pile of rubbish doesn't work my volume still starts at halfway

Review 8: Low volume cant here it Very low volume need to increase

Review 9: Does not solve the 50% volume warning on Galaxy S7

Review 10: Not very good. Wouldn't read texts at all.",1332,Reviews on the app have been mostly negative. The app does not work on Bluetooth headset or through vehicle audio. It does not solve the 50% volume warning on the Galaxy S7. It wouldn't read texts at all. It doesn't work on the iPhone or iPad.
a2dp.Vol,Positive,"Review 1: Been looking for something to launch and connect my phone to my Acura TLX. Tried a few then found this. Overall it works  but when connected to th car it takes over your phone so if I need to get into phone the hime button does not work  I have to hit the back button and apps button. If it did not make the phone difficult to use while running this app is great  but it is too frustrating to get to email or any other app while this is running and connected to car. July 2016 update: Upped the rating because I was in car mode. The app is pretty good  although the disconnect wifi feature is not working. If this app works for you use it  but I found one a tad more reliable.

Review 2: Excellent app that works very well. Totally free with no ads. Running Moto G3 with marshmallow 6.0 this app works very well. It has separate volume presets for media  alarm  notif  and call. It toggles the volumes when the Bluetooth is connected or disconnected to allow you to have special settings to work with your device and return to normal status afterwards. This helped me to improve weak call volume settings in my speakerphone . As a bonus this app even turns on Pandora. Note that this is not a volume booster. It can only go to max volume. It can't go to 11.

Review 3: Exactly what I needed and free! Bluetooth has been a nightmare on my Nexus 6 since the beginning. Recent changes with Android 6.0.1 made it even messier. Never know what you're going to get with volumes. There were also connectivity delays and volume holdovers from other multimedia apps. This app clears all that up! I can set volume by device and it is specifically set up for use in the car which was the number one use for me. I can't thank the developers enough! Thanks so much! A++

Review 4: This seems almost perfect for me. Using the """"voice call stream"""" it interrupts the radio (Ford Sync) as a hands free call and reads the text/message  so no missing them when I am not listening to the """"aux"""" mode of the radio where the """"music stream"""" is usually heard. The only problem I have is that the """"call"""" sometimes does not end after reading the message. I have to manually """"hang up"""" (not the end of the world!). Great app though. Thank you.

Review 5: Different volumes for different devices! If you want to have all your stuff have consistent volumes without constantly adjusting the settings for your car stereo  headphones  Millennium Falcon  bike speakers  etc without fiddling with the settings in PowerAmp and everything else  this works. Don't forget to hit save and give a few options a try; it does work  and it's awesome.

Review 6: AWESOME! Well when it works that is... Well thought out  but not supported anymore. Works some of the time. Does not start up on boot. Will launch an app of choice bit sometimes won't change the volume when connected to a Bluetooth device. Like go find an updated version if this?

Review 7: Solves Android 6.0.1 Bluetooth volume problems Not sure I need all the clever things to do with multiple Bluetooth devices  but by intercepting Bluetooth headset volume calls to Android 6.0.1 on my Nexus 6P  you've solved the volume problems at a stroke. Thank you.

Review 8: On my rooted Nexus 6p with Nougat 7.1.1 it solves the most annoying problem in my first world cupboard of problems - my volume was being reset to 50% every time I connected to a bluetooth media device. This app solves that be automatically raising the volume.

Review 9: Excellent app. Been using it for years on many different phones  to automatically read my text messages though my cars Bluetooth voice stream. Just wish it could direct my google maps voice commands through the voice stream as well. Hopefully some day.

Review 10: I got this app mainly to read text messages through my headset but it will not stay connected most of the time to read them. When it's connected it works great. I will probably end up uninstalling it  if I can't get it to stay connected.",3978,The app connects your phone to your car using Bluetooth. It has different volume settings for different devices.

acr.browser.lightning,Negative,"Review 1: Great Browser  needs an update Update: This browser is crashing more and more and more. We desperately need and update. I have been using it for a while and really like it. But like others have mentioned it needs better tab management - needs open tabs in background  incognito tabs disappear sometimes and can't get back into them. Also """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Save your passwords"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" setting doesn't work and could use better ad & tracker blocking. Freezes and crashes constantly now!""""

Review 2: Bad update This update made me really upset. Many things are broken or won't work like they always did. For example: if I open a link from another app/shortcut on my launcher  it won't open and the browser will show the home page instead. Another bad thing imho is the impossibility to choose  when I open a link in a new tab  to open it on background. On old version this was possible and it would be nice if there's an option to bring it back like I described in this new one.

Review 3: Crashes way too much I really want to give this app a higher rating  but the regular crashes are getting out of hand. It seems to crash after heavy-ish browser use  if the browser was left open for a while  or after certain pages are opened up. It's still my daily driver because the speed and adblock are great  but I don't know if it'll be like that for much longer if the crashing persists. It's not uncommon for it to crash at least twice a day. LG G3 Lollipop

Review 4: Issues Tapping the URL field highlights all current text  indicating it is selected  but when you start typing instead of replacing what was there with what you're typing it simply adds what you're typing where you tapped. Also even with ad blocker turned off it doesn't allow Google ads click throughs and I don't think it can save passwords either which is annoying. Flip side? It's fast and lightweight. Just not the current browser for me

Review 5: Good  but... The tab management is atrocious. There's no background tab option  and whenever you open a new tab  the list of your open tabs closes and you are sucked into the new tab you just opened. This all needs to be reworked. I need background tabs. And I need to manage my tabs (close AND open)  without being dragged out of the menu. Also  inverted rendering still needs a bit of work. Otherwise  a fast  clean browser.

Review 6: It's great but some minor details are annoying. Where is the forward button? You're kinda f***** if you happen to tap back one too many times. There's no option in settings to disable automatic retraction of the tab sidebar. Very annoying if you want to close a few tabs and keep a few. Tapping is not as precise as in other browsers. Sometimes you tap on something you want but end up with something around that you tapped.

Review 7: Perfect Won't let me download anything from the web. Gives me an error """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Cannot download to specified location"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". I have the download location set to default /storage/emulated/0/Download. Clearing data and reinstalling doesn't fix it. EDIT: FIXED. For whatever reason  the app permission was set to not allowing storage access by default. This is a marshmallow issue. Five stars now.""""

Review 8: Clear all tabs? Found it difficult to clear all tabs when not in tab view with the tabs up top. Also buggy time to time and would freeze when opened. Does not load some webpages properly and whenever I try to open an url by google ad services it just directs me to a blank page that is not the url that was displayed. I really want to make this my main browser but sadly I can't because of these drawbacks :(

Review 9: The app is working goof again but still a problem with dowloads Everything is almost working right. But for some reason I can't seem to download any files because it says my location is wrong. I'm not using a custom location but the default. Any fix to this? I have no idea what the location path is either so I can't set a custom path. Especially because we have to manually type out the path

Review 10: Latest updste bad Was a fantastic app but the latest updated version exits without errors whenever a page is loaded. I had to revert to a previously backed up version. *UPDATE* Because of the author's failure to fix ANY of these bugs I have decided to go back to using Firefox. At least it works on my device. Developer has ignored muliple emails asking for support. App no longer usable.",4447,The browser crashed at least twice a day. It crashed after heavy-ish browser use. The tab management is atrocious.

acr.browser.lightning,Positive,"Review 1: Very impressive browser and I love the ad blocker. At first I thought it wasn't working after I turned it on and then I realized I needed to restart the browser. When I did - ads were blocked. Everything works much faster with the ad blocker on - and even without  it seems as fast as Chrome on Android. I give this a 4 star rating because there are some issues: 1. Importing bookmarks from Chrome does not work at all. I tried this on my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone and my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and got the same results. 2. There's a strange thing that happens with the screen when rotating from landscape to portrait orientation. The height of the browser window doesn't go to the bottom of the screen. Refreshing the page does not solve the problem  but tapping the control on the phone/tablet to see all open apps - and then going right back into Lightning does solve the problem. Seems like a bit of a bug - which is easy to reproduce every time and on both my android devices. Other than these issues  I think it's worth every penny of the $1.50 for the ad blocking version.

Review 2: This is the best Android browser I've ever used. It is extremely light and fast (even on my Galaxy smartphone from 2011)  bookmarks are so easy to reach and it looks really functional and minimal with its great fullscreen mode and black AMOLED theme. My favourite feature is the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Inverted Grayscale"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" rendering mode- it transforms my AMOLED smartphone to an e-book reader saving battery. Then there is an option to block ads  set any user agent  activate text reflow and change the text size of any web page. I really can't believe all these features are able to fit in only 2MB (Chrome was taking more than 100MB on my phone  bloating more and more and being incredibly slow to start and browse on my Galaxy S II). I'm happy to recommend this browser to anyone.""""

Review 3: My favorite browser since I discovered it on vacation back in 2013 in California. You will not find a Faster  better browser  I guarantee it and if you do  tell me! Only have seen it on Android  may be other places  wish it was for all platforms. Being on an Android Tablet is even better and more choices. Our may run slower on a PC or Mac type platform  which is the only reason I can see why this browser isn't available everywhere  for if it was and acted the same way as it does on the Android platform  it would surpass Explorer  Chrome  Firefox  all of them as soon as it gained attention. Only thing I can't seem to get working and there is a checkbox for it in Settings  never could get Adobe Flash Player to work with it  but I see no difference. Love it. Ten Stars.

Review 4: Often just opens a blank page when clicking on a link in another app So  I *really* want to love this app. It has the right balance of features  simplicity and looks. Ad blocking is great. However  when the app opens after clicking a link in another app  Lightning just shows its homepage. You have to go back to Twitter  or Facebook or whatever app you clicked the link in  click the link again  and then Lightning opens up again  this time showing the correct web page. With this bug fixed (and the ability to have new tabs open in the background) Lightning would be perfect.

Review 5: After trying close to 15 browsers  this is my favorite I'm very glad to have found this broswer. I was frustrated to find the lg g4 came with chrome(which I'm not a fan of on mobile) in place of the reliable stock browser. I was looking for a broswer that delivered an experience close to the stock browser  and this delivers. Smooth scrolling  bookmarks easily accessible on the side  full screen mode  and great ad blocking make for the best web experience I have found. I would definitely recommend this broswer. Kudos to the developers!

Review 6: Great Browser...open source all the way! Anthony did a great job here!...i love THIS browser!...i tried many others...like Dolphin Browser(total crap in my opinion!...almost broke my phone with it!...it Destroyed YouTube on my phone!...plus made a mess with my file system... scrambled it fiercely !...busy fixing it now...work  work work!...I tried Opera Chrome Firefox...Together with Lightning Browser...all works well in harmony!...but NOT !Dolphin Browser!...So i paid For Lightbing Browser and i am Totally happy with it!!

Review 7: Excellent Thought I'd reviewed this when I first installed over a year ago  apologies. OK  I avoid using apps when possible  so all of the usual suspects like FB  eBay  Amazon are accessed through a browser and this one by far and away seems the best for how I use my phone. I like that it doesn't need any extra permissions than the ones needed to actually work. Seems to have excellent compatibility  I can't remember coming across a site that hasn't worked or allowed me to have full functionality. Highly recommended!

Review 8: Pretty good! Been looking for a decent adblock browser. I think this might be it! Really like the clean interface. Really cool that you can turn off status bar. Took me a few minutes to get used to but then realized quickly that I really like the slide out panels for tabs  navigation  and bookmarks. Seems fast and smooth thus far. Settings cover everything needed. One slight complaint is text wrap could be better. See Opera for zoom and text wrap done right. Btw  someone ripped off ur hard work. See Deebrowser...

Review 9: Only Browser You Need! Fantastic collection of features that is updated regularly. Has one of the better implementations of reverse rendering  but it would be nice if this feature could be toggled without having too access a preference sub-menu...Maybe in a future update perhaps? (Hint  hint :D ). More than worth the minor cost and the only Android browser you need. I have not been experiencing random crashes as other reviewers have complained about. Fast and stable on my M8 with CM12 based PacRom LP-5.1!

Review 10: Best browser UI Expected features/improvements : 1/ bookmarks: subfolders  synchronization. Opera speed dial could be a source of UI inspiration although subfolders are not supported 2/ Tab bar: the native vertical tabs organization could allow tree management (e.g. Firefox addon Tree Style Tab). Helpful for those who open a lot of tabs and intend to quickly understand how tabs relate and close/collapse them accordingly. 3/ Contextual websearches within Lightning instead of Google search.",6456,Lightning is the best Android browser I've ever used.

app.easytoken,Negative,"Review 1: Just one token 4stars for the moment because you cannot add more than one tokens at the same time. Unfortunately I had to change to another app due to this. If this is fixed it will well deserve the 5 stars.

app.easytoken,Positive,"Review 1: Great RSA Replacement for 4.4.4 OS I tried to get the RSA native client working but it wouldn't import from either QR code or URL. I added this app and moved my RSA .SDTID file to my Samsung Galaxy S5 and was able to install and configure my device and was logged in with my software token in less than 30 seconds. Sure beats the heck out of downloading all the JAR files and nonsense that one has to do with the native RSA conversion application. GREAT JOB!!!

Review 2: Works great The official rsa secureid app started being flaky with the most recent update. My it department asked me to reinstall and sent me a qr code. I used that code to reactivate the rsa official app and this one. But I much prefer this one due to the widget.

Review 3: Do not even bother with the official RSA app. This one is brilliant. The only improvement I would want is to be able to get tokens to tasker (via intents) so that I can push the token to my Pebble... Please Kevin - any chance?

Review 4: For people who use their RSA token frequently  this is a real time saver! This app comes with a widget for quick access to the token ? the original RSA SecurID app has no such thing.

Review 5: Great alternative for RSA Soft token .sdtid file can be imported in this unlike the original rsa app for android. Thanks for this utility  it helps alot.

Review 6: Been using it for years  here is a future update feature request: make it possible to import multiple tokens.. that will earn you five stars

Review 7: Amazing app This is really cool app. It helped me transferring token from previous device without going through IT team.

Review 8: Great replacement No need for RSA token conversion. stdid file will be taken up. Plus u get a widget. Truly amazing.

Review 9: Better than original RSA SecuID app. Able to import directly from folder. Thanks pal!

app.openconnect,Negative,"Review 1: Be sure to disable """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Always-on VPN"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" on other VPNs Great app! Just one minor note: I started seeing OpenConnect silently drop/fail when trying to connect (with no logs or other indication anything was wrong!). Turns out  I had enabled Google Wi-Fi Assistant's """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Always-on VPN"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" setting under my VPN configuration. Once I disabled that setting  I was able to connect successfully. (What's worse is that setting is common to all Android VPNs; it does not appear to do anything for Google Wi-Fi Assistant.)""""

Review 2: Isn't vpn supposed to be all about security and privacy? Then why oh why does Open Connect/Cisco need access to my photos and media files.. most of the other vpn's don't ask for anything. ..so why do you need access to ours?

Review 3: Um amazing No one should ever use the anyconnect one. This one rules. One thing I'd like to see though is a persistent notification so I can quickly get to the app

app.openconnect,Positive,"Review 1: Works even better in Android 6.0 With Android 6.0  the VPN settings interface now shows OpenConnect as an option. It can be opened or disconnected from there  which is good if a connection is unstable and you want to retry it. However  the best change is the VPN Service API dialog (the one that confirms your connection on Android 4.0 or later) is gone after a one-time popup on the very first time you use OpenConnect. Now  subsequent times (even after rebooting) can connect without any prompts whatsoever!

Review 2: Excellent app - better than the official Cisco product Faster  more stable  and more compatible than Cisco's own offering. Plus by allowing for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Reported OS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" masking your company doesn't have to pay Cisco's separate fee to license mobile device connectivity - your VPN thinks the OpenConnect client is just another PC (personally  I recommend setting """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Reported OS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Linux (32-bit)"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".""""

apps.droidnotify,Negative,"Review 1: Gone bad Does not work well on my moto x 1st Gen. Kitkat 4.4.4. Popups seem random at times. Text popups appear when Gmail arrives. Or the opposite. Requiring dual programs (Notify and notify+) are very confusing and awkward and a long promised streamlined version has never materialized. Was good at first but seems abandoned.

Review 2: Withdrawing my 5 stars Because this app has a serious bug. The delete button on sms notification doesn't delete messages or some messages. But that is actually I want this program to do ;delete messages after reading them. Emailed the developer but no news. Samsung galaxy s4 mini GT-I9192 android 4.2.2

Review 3: Great idea way too unmanageable It is notifying everything constantly.. it's out of hand every single app that does anything it's notifying and I can't get rid of the poping sound of it also.. Are they trying to drive me crazy so you'll pay for the upgrade??

Review 4: A con  Basically. So I buy Pro to get a few app notifications... fine. I then realise that I'd also have to buy Plus simply to get Gmail notifications. Developer  if you're that desperate for cash I suggest you fleece your granny and not Android punters.

Review 5: I have to give a poor rating because the developer has chosen to make dozens of add-on apps which wastes our space. Plus a Pro and a Plus version you must buy both to get basic features.

Much better than stock android notifier to inform you of missed notifications (calls  texts  emails) Highly customizable. Only down side I can see right now is that it uses a lot of system resources. Recommend using only if you have more than 1 GB of RAM installed  otherwise it may not function properly. e.g.- The notification might not pop up until an hour after a missed call.

Review 2: Polished! Love the pop-up. Everything works nice now. I appreciate that it allows me to dismiss reminders by giving me a lot more snooze options than just 30 or 60 minutes. A wish.... That i could activate a text response by voice! Regardless  well done! Updated  after update to kk4.4.2 the app no longer removes the messaging apps notification.

I know a set K of people whose addresses I have and I want those contacts accessible and backed up not separated on different services. As it stands this is useless.

at.bitfire.davdroid,Positive,"Review 1: 1st Class Customer Care As a recent user of the Android OS I was having real trouble syncing my phone with a Mac OS specific CRM app called Daylite. I spoke with both Daylite and DAVDroid support  both of which were remarkably helpful. Sadly though  only one of them could find a solution to issue I was having and it was the guys at DAVDroid. They were absolutely first class and worth far more than the initially outlay of purchasing this app. Quick responses and genuine concern to resolve the issue warrants six stars!

Review 2: Very nice! I've been using DavDroid because it's open source and with the belief it would eventually offer full-featured sync with Kolab. With this last update it now delivers on that promise  along with a very nice Material Design interface.

Review 3: Works good Works good with Nextcloud. But if you have MIUI (launcher on Xiaomi devices) you HAVE to add davdroid to autorun  or it won't work even manually. It's a bit weird  but anyway  it works perfectly now.

Review 4: Just the job After years of keeping data separate rather than use Google services  I finally got round to looking for a solution. Early days but this app (together with Radicale) fits my needs perfectly.

Review 5: 1st class service I have problem synchronizing contact as I update the app. I send an email  and they reply quickly. The problem was solved. Really super app and very good support from the developer.

Review 6: easy to use very easy to use! it made the jump from the iOS environment to android a lot easier (my contacts and appointments are still in icloud). it also has a nice UI.

Review 7: Nice to be in control of my data I've been using davdroid for a couple years now and it is not only a great app but it has consistently gotten better. Highly recommended.

Review 8: Excellent app and does exactly what it says. Very simple and combines contacts and calendar. Support is superb if you have a real problem. Definitely a great app to have

Review 9: Works like a charm - DAV sync should be native in Android - but can't blame the dev of this app for making some money of this issue - thanks for providing a solution

Review 10: fix the bugs you describe in the read more section and implement them in the main app so no need for work arounds. Also keep up the good work 😉.

Review 2: ODS file issues My open calc file has three columns. The second columns can span several lines. I find out if reading on android device the second column will stretch out in one single line and overlap the third column so I cannot really make out the two columns at all. In my original document there is no carriage return for the data in the second column but I still think the viewer itself should be intelligent enough to recognize the column width to break things into as many lines as required so it won't overflow into neighbouring columns

Review 3: Unpolished  imprecise Firstly  it loads each of my sheets with formatting errors - background colors from a group of cells are continued for two additional cells within the same column  or a random section is transposed to another part of the sheet. Secondly  each time I attempt to open a document it displays an advertisement which  when dismissed  does not then proceed to my document but returns me to the main menu from which I have to dig through my files a second time to open the file. The second time  the file loads.

Review 4: Major bugs/shortcomings LG G4 Android 5.1 1) App always downloads a very abbreviated version of a spreadsheet instead of the full version. Most of my spreadsheets apparently are too big  but there seems no way to just load the full file as the default. 2) The description says it can edit a file  but I found no way to do this and I'm not the only person who has this problem according to their comments on Facebook. Clicking the pencil icon says to make changes and then SAVE  but there's no way to make the changes.

Review 5: This app + Kingston Office ! View  open  edit  create  save any document either from Microsoft office formats and OpenOffice formats and PDFs also. Exactly what I was looking for - lightweight app for viewing and editing OpenDocuments. It takes 5 3 MB of storage - fantastic. I have downloaded AndrOpen Office before  it was big (cca 50MB) and it was no good for my phone (4'')  it didn't fit on screen and it wasn't well optimalized for android (interface almost like PC version and zooming was wierd)

Review 6: Don't ever use this! At first I thought this app was great-finally a decent way to read and edit my odt files! But then I edited a complete document  which took me almost an hour. After re-reading all the changes  I pressed 'save' and it said 'saved under modified by open office reader'. So I checked that out- and found the old document  with several edited lines  but most of it was just the original version. So an hour of work was basically gone. Thank you  shittiest app ever created!

Review 7: Ugh... This is a good app to view your .odt files. The only big problem I have is that when editing them  if you change from portrait mode to landscape mode  it exits editing mode and everything you just wrote is gone. It's so frustrating. And another little problem I have is when I save edited files  they save as a different file. It may just be because the file is from Dropbox and can't save directly to it  but it is extra work to rename and put it back into Dropbox.

Review 8: Works... with issues It opens .odt files  which I needed  but it argues every time about where and how to save them  and instead of allowing me to choose any options when saving changes to the open file  it just creates a new file  saves on the internal sd instead of the external  and always names it modified-by-my-half-assed-product or something similiar. I am uninstalling. This program is too annoying with its lack of user-oriented choices

Review 9: Has some nagging issues When temporarely switching to another app and coming back  it will show the history revision file  which gets on my nerves. When opening medium or large sized files  you have to go into the menu and select the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Reload without limit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option to sed the complete document; the app should have the smarts to do this on its own or warn the user if there is insufficient memory to do so.""""

Review 10: lost opportunitiesloo kk Worked well at first try  allowing me to download and attach to emails  send out  no problema. Then I tried to edit same document and whoa......what a messs! It was my resume and didnt save my edits  added sentances and I believing edits were saved  sent my resume out! I wondered why no one called me for a job then realize my rresume made me sound like I had Dementia. Check it out maybe its dementia! m",5051,LG G4 Android 5.1 comes with the TomTom reader app. The app can be downloaded from the Google Play store. It is not compatible with Apple's iOS 8 software. It can only be used with the Android version of the LG G4.
at.tomtasche.reader,Positive,"Review 1: Good for reading Very handy for reading ODT files (though why on earth should this need a separate app when you already have one or other of the Office-type packages installed?). In my limited testing on my Nexus 4  flexible text wrap didn't seem to be supported  so although you can zoom in  reading at larger text sizes requires horizontal scrolling. And editing is a bit clunky – as another reviewer pointed out  rotating the display loses unsaved edits. Still  this is a good app if you need to handle ODT. I'd like a paid ad-free version.

Review 2: Love it! Since I've been using open office to write a big story (personal project)  this app has allowed me to read my saved chapters on the go. I had no trouble opening my files and the simple and clean ui allowed for a smooth read. My only issue is that the edit document option doesnt work. A little irritating when I come across spelling mistakes I wish to fix on the spot. And to those complaining about the app not opening .doc files  maybe try reading the app info. It opens open office specific files.

Review 3: Tried several other .odt file readers and they could not open these files sent thru gmail  even when I downloaded them individually.. Kept getting message 'you dont have an application to read this file""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""..It may have been my lack of understanding of HOW to do this  but with OpenDocument Reader  there was no hesitation and I didn't have to read the instructions (LOL) the app just opened the odt file....Fantastic!.... Thank You Mr. Tascchauer....A perfectly good app..... Peter""""

Review 4: Very good reader This is a very good reader  it also has support for editing documents but for big documents it was very very slow for editing to the point that i would say it was unusable. I have a Nexus 5 phone so it is one of the top phone and it couldn't handle editing a document. This was as of 04/27/14 so they might be able to improve. But it does what is saids it will do that is read Libreoffive documents and it does it well

Review 5: Still use it every day! But... Any progress on those config-file options Thomas? Since I've bought this  I've wasted *thousands* of keystrokes just getting to the point of using my files! I've got to load every file twice  go to full screen  play with the zoom... and then  if I tilt the phone the wrong way while putting the phone in it's place on my dashboard  I've got to do it all over again. ARGH! But I still love it...

Review 6: best of the open document apps! Until LibreOffice of Android becomes available (if ever)  this is the best app for accessing and modifying odf/ods files. It handles password protected documents without a hitch and flawlessly integrated with the Hammerhilll printer app for printing documents to my WiFi printer. As new features get added to this there is no reason for OpenOffice or LibreOffice for Android. Nice work!

Review 7: OpenDocument Reader Absolutely fantastic! I was despairing of being able to read some very important documents on my phone when the excellent EE store in Ramsgate found this for me. Be aware that only part of the document will be shown unless you rapidly click on the message box at the top which instructs you to do this to view the full document. The message is only there for a few seconds. Love this app!

Review 8: Pretty good. Has some issues. With long documents occasionally just loads a blank screen (even if I leave it to load for ages) and if I turn my phone sideways it often jumps back to the start of the document and loses my place. Otherwise it is good  loads fast and so far works on all of my documents I've asked it to open. Easy to read  good zoom levels  and works in all orientations of the phone.

Review 9: It works  but comments are just dumped on the screen The whole point of comments in a spreadsheet is to hide lots of detailed information or a long description of a cell inside the comment. This app just dumps the comments on the screen. It would be better if the cells woth comments have a red dot and a click shows the comment full screen or something. Useful app. Thanks for making it.

Review 10: Works flawlessly! Obviously the interface could do with a lot of work  but this application works flawlessly and without issue... A native version of LibreOffice would be preferable  but until this eventuates  this is the best that's out there for users of the OpenDocument Formats. I love the fact that users can voluntarily donate to the developer  and I encourage all users to do so...",4528,OpenDocument Reader is a free app for Android. It can be used to read and edit LibreOffice documents. It is not yet compatible with LibreOffice or other Office-type software.

Review 7: Much Better Than Samsung's Auto Brightness Installed on Samsung Galaxy S4 Active on Kit Kat and now Lollipop. Very rarely have to adjust brightness manually. Maual adjustment is about 90% and minimum brightness is about 25%. Samsung's Auto setting was always too dark indoors with no overhead light.

ca.mimic.apphangar,Negative,"Review 1: Second row may or may not show up I enabled the second row. Sometimes it's there  sometimes it's gone. I use around 10 apps daily so a second row is really needed so that I don't have 10 icons squeezed in one row. I could have tone it down to show 5 apps per row but without the second row to show the remaining 5 apps it would defeat the purpose of wanting to have the most convenient access to my 10 frequently used apps. Please look into this bug (if it's actually a bug) or tell me if I configured it incorrectly.

Review 2: ? I really can't find a good use for this app. All it is is relocating your most used apps so you can see your wallpaper a bit better  but it removes the instantaneous access to the apps I have on my home screen(the apps I use the most  duh!).

I used to love this app  but now I can't give a higher grade if I can't use it ):""""

Review 4: Really clever Considering as replacement to old Custom Notification  but doesn't support shortcuts/widgets in addition to apps. For example  need to pin some frequently used custom setting shortcuts to bar (as in xShortcut or QuickShortcutMaker). Also some apps inexplicably don't appear in list after use so can't pin ??? Otherwise first rate.

Review 5: Pls allow manual sorting Although weighed sorting is good. But it gets heavily skewed when playing a game for 1 hour  that too when I play only once a week. I prefer if we had the ability to sort manually. Pinning does work but I still cannot sort as per my liking. I haven't constantly pin/unpin/open app just to get the 'order'correct.

Review 6: A good idea  but... Hangar seemed like a good idea but I never really used it. Worse  it seemed to slow down the redrawing of the desktop when returning from applications so eventually I just turned it off and rebooted. I guess I couldn't get used to application quick launch icons up under the taskbar.

Review 7: Not working Like the app but only if it worked. Its not pinning any apps for me. The widget stays empty and so does the notification bar. Reply to Jeff: Well would love to test but it has to at least run first. :) Its not doing nothing so there is nothing really to test. :)

Review 8: Icon pack does not work After installing this app I installed Moonshine icon pack & made changes in the app. But it made no change to the notification drawer icon color. However icons got applied in my phone which has Kitkat 4.4.2. Let me know if there is any fix.

Review 9: Was OK when I first had android 5. Had to do a factory reset now the only icon it will show is itself!!!!!! Don't want to have to use a different one so please fix. Was good but now crap. Perhaps it caused the need for a factory reset? Who knows!!

Review 10: Conflicts with mail notification Before using Hangar  I could archive my emails from my notification screen. Now  after using HangarI can see the email hut there isn't enough room for the archive button. That is only complaint.",3336,Hangar is an app that lets you move your most used apps to the top of your home screen. The app is not working on the LG G3 yet. Some apps inexplicably don't appear in list after use so can't pin them.
ca.mimic.apphangar,Positive,"Review 1: Great app that solves a real problem Like most people  I have lots of installed apps but only use a handful on a daily basis. It gets tiresome paging through a launcher and who really spends the time to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""curate"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" their home screen shortcuts? Hangar automatically gives you immediate access to the apps you use most. I wouldn't be surprised if something like this was integrated into Android at some point. Only issue I've had is the multi row notification randomly deciding not to be multi row. I prefer the desktop widget anyway - it rocks!""""

Review 2: Cannot say enough about this app!! Honestly hands -down best developed app out here! Only reason I hesitated at first was I assumed this app would require a large amount of space(as with all constantly running apps). Idk how the developer did it  but Hangar has never gotten above 7mb! Runs constantly  actively learns and stays between 4-7mb. How and wow??!Performs flawlessly  apps change based on usage. Would pay for Hangar...and for developer to make all my apps run like this one! I sure hope Jeff Corcoran becomes a name I see a lot of!!

Review 3: Graduated From Bar Launcher... ...which spoiled me by offering easy access to apps. Decided to switch to Hanger because of significantly more customizations. Thankfully the app description and other reviews expressed the wide array of choices. For example; the weighted option had NO appeal to me  but it's optional! The blacklisting feature really won me over. It only took a few minutes of configuration to achieve perfection! ADDED 5th Star! Continues to work perfectly!

Review 4: Almost perfect! Simple yet versatile! If only there was a drag & drop option to rearrange the app icons. Pinning the app and changing the order with 'Pinned app sorting' option is all good and stuff  however it would be much more easier to have a drag & drop option. Also  it'll be great to have all apps listed in Hangar rather than limiting them to the ones that is frequently used. Divider is a bit rectangle-ish  a more square design will make it look more presentable.

Review 5: Just 1 'but' This application is so good  since I like my front screen clean. There is just 1 single problem  all app treated like they were opened from the first time  not picking up from where I left off. I hope in the future the devs would do something about this. Overall  it's still a great app. Might re-use it when somehow they add a feature when instead of always opening from the first time  you could pick up where you left off like how a task manager would do.

Review 6: Notification icon EDIT: To make the notification icon disappear  go to behavior tab  click on notification position and set to bottom. This must of gotten reset after the update. Hope this helps others having problems. Really useful app  access my top apps from any screen. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it used to work without a persistent notification. After October update it only works with notification icon. Still very useful but a bit annoying.

Review 7: The last piece in a perfect launcher setup! I do not know what I would do without Hangar. It makes my most used apps available at all times on my home screen. And it's smart so it knows what I use and how long I use it. A phenomenal productivity tool and strangely enough the only one of it's kind. It takes a bit of setting up but when done you are always only a tap away from where you want to be. Applause! ?

Review 8: Was Great I loved this app and it worked great  however since updating to Lollipop on my Verizon branded Galaxy S5  it no longer works. I Uninstalled and reinstalled the app  but every time I try to give it permission like it asks for  it stops responding and shuts down. *EDIT* After following the authors instructions  the app works flawlessly and is again one of my favorite apps.

Review 9: Good app.. Would like more customization options As others have mentioned it takes some training of your brain to remember your apps are in the notification area  but it keeps my home screen clean and I like that. I would like to see the option to turn monitoring off and the user able to arrange the icons. I know what I like to use and the order I want it in. No monitor needed.

Review 10: Awesome! Exactly what i was looking for! The only thing I could add  would be to either make it possible to use the widget before it is set  or explicitly inform the user in the instructions that they need to configure and save the widget settings to make it accessible. I spent 10 mins trying to figure out how to make the widget appear in my phone desktop",4646,Hangar automatically gives you immediate access to the apps you use most.

So I'm looking up a word that I'm to dumb to spell then I accidentally hit a button and then push back and it closes the app then I have to use the mic again because it won't save the word. Wtf.

I hope you take my feedback in concern . I am seeing forward for a better version of this ♡♡♡♡☆☆☆☆

Review 2: Just downloaded this app after seeing it  read a few reviews to ensure it wasn't wack. And boy oh boy  im just loving it for the very few minutes of use.. A big thank you to the developers.. I hope you peeps don't destroy the app in time to come though. Its just what writers like myself need. I can listen to my poetry being read  find words with ease n writing just became less tedious.. A big thank you again to developers kf this app.. 👍

Review 5: It's the best literally I've tried all the apps for rhyming and it's simply the best. Hat's off to UI development  it makes the app the most efficient and best in its class. Although just like other websites and apps you can't find all the rhyming words  it still depends on your vocabulary and wordplay ability. After all writing a song is an art and it should be pure?

Review 6: I've been writing poetry and songs since I was 13 years old I am 29 now and I feel this is the best app ever for me!! Always the one app I can turn to when I get stuck trying to think of words that rhyme. This does it for and it also introduces me to words I've never heard of before!! For someone lile me you can't beat that!!! Thank you so much for this app!!!

Review 7: Fast and useful. It could be prettier; for example  why waste screen space with the app title and magnifying glass? Why not a floating search button and cut the page header area in half? Minor gripes for an extremely useful and well organized tool. Please keep up the good work and give me a way to support your effort without introducing ads!

Review 8: Man  this is sweet! I tried it this day and it was smooth all throughout! I replaced my old famous dictionary (with unnecessary games) with this one for that consumed me more space on my storage. Sometimes  people just need a simpler ones like this app. Nice job to the rhyming systems  absolutely a help for poets like me. Great work guys!

Review 9: Thank You! ? A BIG HELP! Recently  I've been interested in making poems and I admit that I lack on my vocabulary words. I'm a Filipino and this is a big help.

ch.blinkenlights.android.vanilla,Negative,"Review 1: Playlist support is very counter-intuitive. Just before I posted this review (which would have been very different)  I figured it out. To actually play a whole playlist rather than one track from it  you have to long press on the name of the playlist and then select play from a bunch of options in a list that pops up. Who would think of that? Poor UI decision there. You should either let people know how that works  or just put a big """"""""""""""""Play all"""""""""""""""" button beside each playlist in the list. The point is to make it convenient to fire up a playlist when you're on the go  not fiddle around with submenus. I very nearly uninstalled this because it appeared to be unable to handle .m3u playlists properly. Additionally  we NEED the ability to filter out folders that contain audio but not music. That's a serious flaw that any decent player has addressed long ago.""""

Review 2: This dev wouldn't answer an email on the fact that 2 updates ago it stopped finding all my songs & I've had this app 5 years. After nougat update I noticed it was possibly draining my battery. Uninstalled it and it wouldn't install again no matter what. So it was causing issues and I have an S7. I can deal with that issue  but not a dev that doesn't answer emails.

Review 3: replay gain and flac Great music player  light  supports replay gain and all my music types. The only flaws are that with the latest patch i can't long tap a song in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""now playing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""add to playlist"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and ordering the songs in a playlist messes up sometimes""""

Review 4: Just spent over 2hours making killer playlist. Went to put songs in order I wanted and it erased most of my list of over 200 songs. Left with about 30 and 1/3 of those are now doubles. Glitchy to say the least. Totally fucked me

Review 5: My only complaint is that there is no option to choose which folders to include or exclude in the library. UPDATE: Vanilla uses the Android media system... To exclude a folder  place an empty file named '.nomedia' in the folder

Review 6: good....but Have changed my filebrowser root folder  but when I did a rescan it still did the whole device. This is tedious when I have a 1Tbyte USB drive connected. I only want to scan my music folder. :/

Review 7: Issue with equalizer I prefer vanilla music over the other music app. However when start playing music  I always have to manually click the equalizer option to get the effect. Any idea why?

Review 8: fast and lightweight  BUT can't move song progress bar to bottom  doesn't play automatically whole folder when you tap on first song in folder view and few other annoyances

ch.blinkenlights.android.vanilla,Positive,"Review 1: The music player I always wanted. Google's music player has lots of strange behaviors when it's offline  so I was looking for something that could handle music stored on my phone. This free  opensource app has almost every feature I could want! My favorite features (hidden in settings): ●Start playing when launched (great for when you're in the car) ●Playlists ●Only play through headphone (can't mistakenly play over external speaker) Still missing a few features I'd like  but since it's open source  I can add them myself!

Review 2: There are three things that I would love to see but it's okay if developer don't have time. 1. Please make the back button on the folder based tab exit the app if we have set the folder as default music folder instead of going back to directory. 2. I hope in folder based the music directory lists all folders as if they are playlist instead of going inside a folder where another folder exists. 3. Lastly it would be perfect if selecting a song enqueues all within the same folder. Thank you very much for this perfect app.

Review 3: Better than the stock Android app. A masterfully coded  efficient piece of software. Works great  plays all file formats I throw at it (FLAC  MP3  ogg  ect.) and stores playlists by their file path so I don't have to remake my playlists when I delete my music folders and add new songs. Incredibly efficient  has tons of features  loads almost instantly  and the UI is great. IT uses vector images  so the app is incredibly small  too!

Review 4: Awesome no frills music player Vanilla music player is best for those who just like to listen their music on a player with clean interface. It allows to browse music by genre  artist   album  folderwise etc. Vanilla player need to add setting to exclude certain folder of songs from appearing in the music library. Also id3 tag editor is missing.

Review 5: One of the better apps around! Lightweight yet fully functional music player. I've tried a lot of the other music apps and due to either bugs  bloat  poor playback  lack of features  excessive battery or data usage I keep returning to Vanilla Music app. It may not be perfect but it's better than Google play music and fighting with its bugs!

Review 6: quite good  with a number of options. Best of all  are hardly any permission needed! however  it doesn't play .ogg files - from the 'Files' tab  when i select the file  there is a pop-up saying """"0 files playing"""" and nothing is played. so far i've tried mp3 and aac and both works.

ch.blinkenlights.battery,Negative,"Review 1: Almost what I was looking for :( The app could be perfect... COULD be  unfortunately... All I want is a super simple percentage number in the status bar and an app that doesn't drain my battery. So far  so good! However  the number is way too small (don't need that circle  already have a graphical indicator)  but even that I could live with. What I definitely don't like is the permanent notification about charging/discharging. Why isn't it possible to disable that???

Review 2: Perfect Little App I've been using this app for over 2 years. I wouldn't be happy without it. I thought Lollypop would make this app obsolete. WRONG! The Lollypop battery status is grey on grey and a separate percentage  which eats up 2 slots of value Notification real estate. Samsung Note 3  Lollypop 5.0.

Review 3: One of the first apps I installed One of the first apps I installed on my first Android. Sort of sad to see that it seems like it hasn't gotten much traffic lately. Doesn't seem 100% compatible with newer models. Options are missing since the button was removed from newer phones.

Review 4: Font is too small! Please make the font much bigger! If it is so small I can't read it at a glance  and can barely read it when squinting  it isn't very useful to me. Uninstalled for an app that's similar  but only ~59K vs ~1100K  and uses a larger  readable font.

Review 5: Bland. No customization AT ALL. It shows the battery percent in upper left as tiny icon...actually hard to read. It cant be size adjusted or color coded by the user. Its vanilla ice cream  and not even French vanilla or vanilla Bean!

Review 6: Not working properly It was working fine until yesterday after I updated it  now the numbers are wrong  they show I still have most charge but in reality my batt is already low...aren't updates suppose to improve the app?

Review 7: Doesnot work properly At the start  this worked fine but now even my battry charge decrease   its shows the same value for a long time. Once my chrge went to 17 but it shows 60 constantly. Its an incomplete product.

Review 3: Doing what it says it will do. Watching as the day goes along and seeing the percentage drop and still matching the system correctly. Had another one  but it tried to save power  AD driven  unwanted warnings that other things also took care of. This is perfect without all the extra battery wasting extras.

Review 4: Shows wrong percent on locked screen Droid maxx 2 shows the percent the phone was booted on and doesn't change unless phone is rebooted but then is stuck at whatever percent it was at when rebooted. The app works great on an unlocked screen will give 5 stars if this problem is fixed

Review 5: Still very useful  even with ICS Although ICS has an option to show battery percentage in the notification bar  this app is much better: better visuals  more display options. Works flawlessly on my Galaxy S3. UPDATE: 1.85 is broken. Notification icon does not update anymore...

Review 6: App showing it's age. This is one of the very first apps I ever downloaded about 7 years ago. It's fantastic on many levels. As android progresses I've lost some access to functions once available. Controls need to be updated to restore full user interface.

Review 7: Percent in the status bar is to small. Please increase the percentage size! Make it the same size at the clock or give us the option to increase the size from 1 to 100  that way we can make it just right to our liking. Other wise its a great app.

Review 3: Looks decent but it's not Installed this app to customize the clock font of the Always On Display for my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. It appears to have spiffy options but it wasn't what I needed. I decided to uninstall. I was unable to uninstall via the phone settings and part of the problem was that I allowed the app to run as a phone administrator. It wouldn't deactivate as a phone administrator. Had to uninstall from within the app by selecting the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" circle icon in the upper right and selecting the uninstall hyperlink.""""

Review 4: Music Player  App use of more power...!!! It has pause and change of song but not stability once only it visible and if screen off and after on invisible. Lockscreen and active mode should both in same option and in notification tray it should be invisible. I don't like it Using More Ram and Battery fix it and not stabile some times. Gestures should have access to use phone apps.it can be easily bypassed by pressing minimize button home button  accidentally touch or pressing of any button fix it  R u work r not no update for your app I hate u...!!

Review 5: It's cool  but I need some help  I'm using asus zenfone5  I'm not quite understand how to replace the lock screen display system with acdisplay lockscreen.  because I already following the instruction and it's still not working.  The second problem is  it will """"Locked"""" with Acdisplay whenever a new notification come up. So I had no choice to disable it  and just waiting till it fixed. I know it's still beta  and I will look forward when you fix it  thank you in advance.  p.s.: Maybe it just me that missing some step but I don't know. Need help.

Review 6: Absolutely gorgeous and simple But is a glitchy mess which constantly fails to work. I enable the lock screen but when I unlock the screen  it gets directly unlocked without showing the actual lock screen. I enable active mode  but I have to manually press the power button everytime I take it out of my pocket. If I lock it and immediately unlock it the lock screen appears twice. If I scroll down my notification bar and lock it  the bar remains on the lock screen. It also constantly keeps taking screenshots of the lock screen. Uninstallin

Review 7: Dripping with potential.... But... This app has more potential than any I've ever seen. This has the capability of becoming one of the best third party lock screens out there.... But it's just too laggy. There are far too many problems. 25% of the time  it doesn't even open and my stock lockscreen takes over. And don't even get me started about when I try to play music. To conclude  I think this app has the potential to be the fastest  most practical lockscreen out there  but it simply isn't written to perfection yet. One day...

Review 8: Nice  but one irritating bug Everytime a notification comes in when my screen is on  acdisplay keeps activating (i.e. the acdisplay lock screen shows up). Please fix this bug as the notifications come in when I perform urgent tasks. Thank you. P.s. also  when I wave my hand over the proximity sensor even by accident while the screen is on  the app goes straight to the lockscreen. I'm genuinely """"""""""""""""pissed"""""""""""""""" by this annoyance. My videos stop playing  my presentations screw up  all because the lockscreen activates.""""

Review 9: I don't get it Either I'm completely stupid or there's nothing to this app. It's like stripping the default Android notifications of all its usefulness  all its functionality  taking away anything that was intuitive about it  and replacing it with something in the beginning of its development phase which is so pointless that it may as well just be a picture. It's like this app is just designed to take all your information. The notifications were simple enough as they were. I thought this may just boost the look of it.

Review 10: Works as expexted  but doesnt solve Android issue This is a great small and free app  but it doesn't solve underlying problem with Android Lollipop 5.0.2 screen lock. I've searched for some app to show small and compact notifications after upgrade from Kitkat 4.4.4 to Lollipop 5.0.2 on my Sony Xperia Z3 compact. Despite this beauty works smooth  it only makes things worse: to unlock a mobile I need to make FOUR actions: press power button  swipe AcDisplay screen  swipe my unlock pattern. This is just ridiculous!",6147,"When using the AcDisplay camera shortcut  you will have to enter your pin before being able to use the camera.

com.achep.acdisplay,Positive,"Review 1: Pretty great lockscreen replacement for AMOLED screens—especially on a Samsung (because their lockscreen is clunky garbage). There are just a few small changes that would make a WORLD of improvement  IMO  such as allowing more than one widget (there's plenty of space  why limit it?)  allowing widgets to be wider (again  the space is there  why the limit?)  being able to have widgets without overriding the stock clock  and being able to reposition the clock/widgets and maybe notification icons too. Also  custom apps/shortcut/actions for the corner gestures would be very useful too. No reason to limit those to phone and camera only. :P And lastly  an option to display ongoing notifications (maybe below the higher priority ones) would be nice too.

Review 2: AcDisplay brings the Active Display mode from Moto devices in a free open source app. The basic feature of this app allows the device's screen to turn when a notification appears and to quickly and easily interact with the notifications. There are 2 other options as well  making this app serve as a lock screen and/or turn on the screen based on device sensors. The overall design is very much minimalistic with a great looking design  and there are also plenty of settings to customize to fit your liking. AcDisplay is great for those wanting to view notifications quickly with a minimal and usable design.

Review 3: I've been using it for quite a while and love it. Only complaints are with lollipop's new lock screen (wish it could go straight to pattern lock rather than slide) The design is elegant and a beautiful way of showing notifications  much cleaner than the lollipop notifications. There is one thing I'd love to have implemented: music control. Would it be possible for you to choose to play/pause/fwd/back depending on what controls are in the notification? Edit: holy crap thank you!! He listened! Edit: Podcast addict does not seem to have playback control. not sure if this is a fix on the display side.

Review 4: Worked just fine for a long time until now and made me almost buy a new phone I used this app for a long time on my Asus Zenfone 5. About 1 month ago  mostly right after unlocking the screen and sometimes randomly  the display tilts/shifts with an absurd angle and goes grayscale and then shortly after phone freezes  makes me do a hard reset. I thought it was a phone problem because I hadn't installed a new app. But then I thought maybe it's about this app  because it happened mostly after unlocking. So i disabled it and the problem solved. Hope this gets fixed. Cheers

Review 5: It works good with the HTc One M7 The only issue I have discovered is the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""AcDisplay services"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the notification shade  it bugs me everytime and it also non-removable  if you have an option to hide that from there  it will be great for a 5-star. Overall  its really good. I highly recommend it if your lockscreen is crap and you want something more like Material Design  but of course  there will be issues that bring down the good things  but if the good things are really good until you forget about the flaws  4 stars will be rated.""""

Review 6: Best option for Moto Display functionality This is the best option for those looking for Moto Display for non-moto devices. I'd gladly give 5 stars as I'm sure a lot of hard work goes into this app  but functionality seems diminished by my finger print security requirements. If I want to use Nexus Imprint then I am required to use a lock screen that employs added security PIN or pattern. Sometimes I'll unlock via the finger print scanner and it will open  but sometimes it'll only open to other lock screen and require my pattern to open. Thanks!

Review 7: Very good  but a work in progress. The settings and features in AcDisplay are adequate  or more than enough for many users. However  the lockscreen beta feature needs a lot of work (I've sent an email regarding some possible fixes). The app itself is basic  and allows everyone to get the most out of it  while it's functions are very aesthetically pleasing. Also  there is a very short delay between the lock screen activating and the screen turning off  which might be noticed by a few people  although most wouldn't figure it out very quickly.

Review 8: works good for Samsung Galaxy s6 works good on Samsung Galaxy s6 some icons are wrong like for inbox and gmail or built in text messenger which shows delivery report right icon  but shows facebook icon for built in text messager messages and don't show textra messenger icon or chomp I've tried but shows handsent   I haven't had others wrong yet but apart from that works well and not a battery drain hardly notice it's running and it hasn't crashed or randomly jumping on screen like some others I tried so just needs few more updates sorted.

Review 9: Minimalistic - but not perfect. Ac display is fantastic and goes extremely well with my launcher on my LG Leon. But every app can be improved. Some improvements that I'd recommend is attempting to remove the constant ac bar notification. Annoying for some android users but nothing too major. Last but not least  I really hope to see different security locks like  a pin number  enter a pattern or swipe to unlock. That has been a very wanted feature with this app and I hope the devs/dev add this in a future update  but for right now. Great

Review 10: I totally love it but... Everything is so subtle and clean. Just one thing  make it more stable for music player. In an instance  I was playing music and in the first time I looked at the screen I saw the toggles of musixmatch player and a blur of the artwork as the background. That was great but I turned the screen of and I turn it back on and everything was back to the clock and the phone's wallpaper. Please fix this because this is one of the best apps.

Review 2: Does the job with some good options  and I can appreciate the option in settings to ignore certain apps for scrobbling  but it doesn't always work. I use Pulsar+ and Podkicker Pro for music and podcasts  respectively. Pulsar+ is listed an an option to disable scrobbling for  but Podkicker Pro does not show up as something to disable scrobbling for  so I always get podcasts in my last.fm list  which I don't want. For the most part  apps will show up with the option to ignore them for scrobbling  but can't give this a higher rating until the issue with Podkicker is fixed.

Review 3: Something is off with this app today. Stopped working then it works and then it stops again off and on  and has not done this for ever. Using BlackPlayer EX and always has worked until today. I tried just now on Listen Brainz but it looks even more simple than Libre.FM and hope they want to add more features. Need to add social and auto refresh listens and Listen Brainz would be awesome. Even a wiki for bands and editing. Need to replace Last.FM. Last.FM sucks bad.

Review 4: BlackPlayer does scrobble. You have to go into the player settings under metatag and set it. Not that hard. If you have hard time then contact BlackPlayer support  because I have scrobbling through BlackPlayer since I bought the app. Best player on Google Play that actually has no issues with this app. I just stopped using last.fm because it sucks so bad  and using libre.fm now. No ads and no nagging to pay for a subscription either.

Review 5: Ugh. Constantly scrobbles the last song that I played on the LG g5 preinstalled default music player. I wrote this in a previous review which has since been deleted. Furthermore the developer email provided in the play store app page FAILS. So this is the only way I can contact the developers  whom asked me what music player I was using besides Spotify. The LG G5 preinstalled music player is.

Review 6: Doesn't work It won't accept my user name and password for last.fm. The website accepts it. Not this app. Too bad. 10.27.16 edit: now also scrobbles seldomly  and chooses what at random. I'd like a response from the developer to help me. I play music using Pulsar plus... I reinstalled and now when I try logging in to last.fm and hit authenticate nothing happens.

Review 7: BlackPlayer support broken? It's reliable for Soundcloud and other players  but the problems start with my main player of choice  BlackPlayer. It suddenly just decides to stop scribbling randomly  and I think it has to do with me leaving my house/WiFi signal. I end up having to reinstall the app numerous times a day. I have OnGoing enabled. Any help?

Review 8: Nothing about this app works other than it downloads which turned out to be a complete waste of time. Scobbles OK until you get to the end of a song then it just vanishes off last.fm. What's the point of having an app that can't do the one thing it's supposed to do? And why does it have to access my personal info on my phone?

Review 2: I like it  pero Sometimes nothing scrobbles at all and it's like ugh so I turned on the On Going thing which is great. Everything scrobbles now because I know when it is scrobbling and when it's not. I just would like in an update that when I stop playing the music  I don't have to force close the app so the notification disappears. It just stays on the last playing song. Hope this gets resolved  thank you for your app.

Review 3: I adore this app - it finally lets me scrobble from Spotify for Chromecast and doesn't have the double scrobble bug that the official Last.fm scrobbler has. My only issue is with Spotify Connect. When controlling music on my PC from my phone roughly 3/4s of songs will double scrobble. Is it possible to disable phone scrobbling when the device's Spotify app is only being used as a remote control for the desktop version?

Review 4: Simple Last.fm works better than Last.fm app. Nevertheless  I had a major problem that pretty much any available scrobbling app wouldn't work offline including Simple last.fm. I've tried everything  but what solved the issue for me was going into the settings of my phone and allowing the simple last.fm app to run even when I turn off (lock) the screen. Worked like a charm. Just thought you should know.

Review 5: I have been using this lightweight app for a while now. It does what it claims and it does so well. A couple of quirks to note: seemingly would not detect Google Play Music though scrobbles this correctly under the 'Android Music Player' despite saying it's not installed. I sometimes get duplicate scrobbles of the same track if I leave the player paused for long periods of time. Keep up the good work!

Review 6: The only option missing - fetching them likes. For example - if I give a thumbs up in Google Play Music  it would be sweet for this app to mark as loved on the last.fm site too! That would be so nice! For folks with Network errors - reinstall! For folks with unrecognized music apps - try again! Have N7  defaul  Google Play Music  Rocket Player  etc. scrobbled without even a hiccup.

Review 7: Doesn't work since that morning for lastfm  librefm works fine Fix it please it won't scrobble  all fine with login  oh now everything works fine but today all day it doesn't work I don't know why  maybe some lastfm systems shutdown or something sorry for bad english great app love you I use kate mobile and default asus zenfone 5 player both works fine

Review 8: This app is great! For the longest time I was really frustrated by it because I could not figure out how to get it to scrobble my songs from Google Play Music. Turns out the scrobbler identifies it as """"Android Music Player"""" or something like that. Thank god for that  now I dont feel like Im missing half of my scrobbles.

com.alfray.timeriffic,Negative,"Review 1: It's mostly good  but has a significantly annoying error which lets it down It works  until I change a setting in the phone's OS interface manually  then it stops working until I restart the app. So for example  let's say I have it set to go silent at 10pm and for the sound to turn back on at 8am. Well  sometimes there will be an exceptional exception (i.e. not one I can program into Timeriffic)  and I will just want to turn it silent for a little bit (using the OS interface) or vice versa  expecting Timeriffic to continue setting the settings as instructed at the scheduled times -- e.g. I might silence it at 9am  and then unsilence it at 10am  expecting it to silence again at 10pm -- but instead it just stops doing it at all  even though the app says it's still enabled. If this error can be fixed  I will donate to the Timeriffic developer/s  but only if they will accept Bitcoin. I don't like registering all my details with third party payment providers  connecting them to my bank account  and giving them a cut of every transaction.

Review 2: Works mostly but no more support or updates for YEARS I've been using this for years without a hitch until now. Used it on my old phones and it was one of the first apps installed on my Note 4. Set it up and forget it- just always worked flawlessly. The brightness control isn't fine enough to set the correct level after MM update. Yet another DEAD app in the Play Store with no support or development. Their website isn't even up any more. Just sell or donate the app to someone who will actually develop and support it!

Review 3: I used this on my Samsung S4 with ICS  and it worked good. Upgraded to Note 5 running Lolipop 5.1.1 and was woke up last night to the sound of a notification  vibration and LED from Facebook. Why? I had notifications  vibration and system sounds all set to off. Also  this app lacks the ability to disable or turn off the LED. Updated 4-30-17: this app no longer works since my Note 5 upgraded to Nougat. The developer web site no longer exists. Sad  this WAS a great app.

Review 4: Randomly works...or not I had an S5 and it worked flawlessly. Since upgrading to an S6 and now S7  it sometimes works and yet maybe it won't. Bottom line...I can no longer trust it to turn ringer off automatically and still have to check manually. I thought the new smart manager might be disabing the app  so turned it off for the app and then off altogether (for all apps)  to no avail. It's unfortunate because this app used to be perfect.

Review 5: Control gps? Dear Devs  is there any chance you could allow the ability to control gps? Someone replied to this earlier with the answer """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""uninstall the app if it's using GPS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" however that's not good. For example  facebook will use GPS but I don't want it to all the time  so turn off GPS but I turn it on for Google maps etc. Hope that helps""""

Review 6: No response from dev I emailed from the app to them twice on this  and have not had a response. On my old phone it was a five star. On my note 4 it brings up the volume but not the notification volume. It says that on this version of Android it cannot split them independently. That's fine  however  I end up with my volume up and my notification volume not brought up!

Review 7: Doesn't work for me I have read the limited FAQ and don't have any task killers running. Running CM 11 on my Galaxy Nexus. I have found it sort of frustrating to get support on this app. No email  just Twitter  Facebook etc. I recently read that the app has trouble with KitKat. Not sure if that is what is going on for me. But it is definitely failing.

Review 8: Installed  used it for a few days  and didn't like the interface  so uninstalled. Unfortunately  many problems and remnants remain: Many of my apps won't sync (e-mail  youmail  others); GPS Status  another app  won't unload; """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Location Found"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" shows in status area.

Review 10: Outdated I can't suppress notifications on my S4  it's not supported. That's a big reason I started using this on my old phone. I don't want them going off at 2am.

com.alfray.timeriffic,Positive,"Review 1: Love this app  but functionality limited by Android L I've loved this app for years  and with the new export and import features it's incredible. Have donated in appreciation. Only remaining request would be the ability to clone/copy profile. Sadly though  there is no way to maintain my original profile of having vibrate off but volume at 10%. This was perfect for me at work but cannot be accomplished any more. Obviously this is an Android fault not Timeriffic  but Timeriffic doesn't make it clear that this functionality wont work any more.

Review 2: Easy to set up  works perfectly! I don't rate apps. Ever. But I'm rating this one  because it's that awesome. My phone turns it's volume on when I wake up  off when I get to work  on during my lunch hour  off when I go back to work  on when I'm driving home and off when I go to bed.. except on weekends when it's on all day until bedtime. I set it up to do all this in less than 5 minutes and now my phone does everything on it's own  thanks to this app! Trust me  this is one of those things you didn't know you needed!

Review 3: Formerly awesome app left behind by lack of updates I've been using and loving this app for years on several different phones. Last update was about 2 years ago now  and as of Android marshmallow (6.0.1)  the app doesn't seem to work reliably anymore. And it's not like it just plain stopped working  it seems to randomly turn my WiFi  Bluetooth  vibrate  and ringer on or off whenever it pleases. I'll happily bump this back to 5 stars if the devs ever update it again.

Review 4: it's an awesome  very powerful app that allows very detailed and personalised automated control of most of the features on the phone. used it on various phones and Android versions without any issues. One thing to note is I had to either go to a ROM or use specific apps (depending on which phone I used) to allow seperate volume for notification and phone rings  but that's not timeriffic's fault. I do wish control over LED notification was included though.

Review 5: GREAT APP I got tired of getting sms messages after bed time  but still wanted my phone to ring if it was called. I went looking and found this app. Works Perfectly! I had a little problem at first and the author quickly responded and got me fixed up! Currently they are trying to raise a little money to add some features. I don't usually say this but I would quickly pay for this app! It lets me sleep at night! Rooted GSIII / note 3

Review 6: It's the best  simplest  easiest to use 'control phone settings by time' app out there. Great when you have to worry about sound levels before and after work or any other time of day when you want to mute/unmute  but don't want to think about it. Hasn't updated in over a year? Doesn't matter to me! I have had the same settings for a couple years and it's never let me down across phones/ROMs/whatever. Solid app for what it does!

Review 7: Very very excellent tool to manage device. The highlight features are the airplane and wifi mode that works exactly as time schedule. Congrats team. I've a request and if you could do this  you are ultimate. The timeriffic works with time  how if it works with geo location. If I reach my office  home  etc.  please let me know your thoughts. Does this application supports the latest version of android (Marshmallow)?

Review 8: brilliant. should be on every handset. Bombroof. Uses next to no resources  never used to go wrong although the latest version does  sometimes.

com.amaze.filemanager,Negative,"Review 1: Thanks for the fast and lightweight manager. It can grow to take place of the ES of the past. Switched from ES because recently  it has become a spam and bloatware heavy app  and the top in battery draining list. Some bugs/suggestions: 1. Copy paste and cut paste notification stays on forever. Therefore next operation in queue won't start. 2. Have to set the default home tabs  each time I open the app. 3. Dual toolbar top (static) and bottom  would have been great. 4. The top ui bar should occupy less space  and be static with address  tabs  three line menu switch  etc. The dynamic style of it hinders easy copy pasting  directory switching etc 5. Grid view is not as comfortable as ES  cannot get the same experience even after adjusting the no of rows

Review 2: Sorry but this is useless. I cannot list all its faults; here's just a few: You cannot have favourite folders  so you will always have scroll to find what you want. There are the usual virtual folders (music  pictures  videos) but they don't find anything on an an SD card (so called """"external storage""""). For some strange reason if you click the music or video folders you get a menu asking if you want to """"Open as"""" tesxt  audio  video or database! What the hell is that about! I could go on  but you get the idea - look elsewhere.

Review 3: Haphazard and Crashy Very much Not the ES Explorer replacement I was looking for. Strange UI where you must scroll to the top of a listing to find the action buttons. Samba looses your directory position so you must renavigate. Lots of forced closes. Right now it has a notify that it is permanently stuck at about 25% copying a file. Selecting that notify takes me to a blank white screen. Swiping Amaze away in the task manager does not remove the notify. Feels like an uphill struggle to do anything. Shame. Uninstalling.

Review 4: So-so Bookmarks can't be edited now? Color of switches in settings should follow accent. Icon color should follow theme  not independent. Loose the lense in the app icon  it's ugly. Make the app icon more material like a material star on material folder  since this app is all about material-ish. Folders/files icons should have a square or round option. G+ should be scrapped  it has no place in any apps nor anyone hearts except G's own. FAB should be consistent  regardless of app toolbar. FAB on top  really?

Review 5: Last version unusable. Could not start because of trying to cast an Integer to String or vice versa during startup. Had to delete app data and lost lot of bookmarks. Then  attempting to search and multiple problems. Click search area to update text and it disappears. Hit back button and app crashes with NPE in some fixSlashes method. Have to uninstall and switch to another  more stable  browser. Too bad  I used this app for a long time but I need something stable.

Review 6: SMB Connection failure Otherwise this seems like a nice and working app but the smb connection is a joke. Everytime I try to login Amaze for some reason deletes the first letter from my username. Other features may work but I couldn't be bothered to try them since I need a functioning smb connection. The FTP connect does work fine though  probably due to there not being a username or password.

Review 7: Simple and clean but needs some polish It is a nice and fast app but the UI needs some improvements. One problem I have with it is that it truncates the names of all files and folders so if you want to know the name of a file you need to long press select it and then go to menu properties  also on selecting files I wish it showed a bar with quick shortcuts to cut  copy  paste  share etc.

Review 8: UI/UX: The fact that the Toolbar is scrollable in Paste mode makes it very inconvenient to paste files: when you want to paste and the Toolbar is not visible  you have to scroll down to bring it  but quite often the swipe to refresh is triggered instead  so you have to have several tries until the Toolbar manages to catch the scroll event. Other than this  good file manager!

Review 9: Video over smb has bad performance I like it overall  but one of my main use cases does not work well. At home I play video from my smb share and the performance is terrible. I use MX player and use the file manager to access the share; in other file manager this works fine but in Amaze it takes a long time to load  has interrupted playback  and often freezes.

Review 10: Screen flickering and crashes Nice file manager  but i see screen flickering when i press """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""+"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" floating button and then press """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""back"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button. If i press """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""+"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and then """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""x"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" animation goes smoothly.

com.amaze.filemanager,Positive,"Review 1: I very much like the clean  intuitive  simple navigation of this file manager. I one issue I have and that is I am trying to figure out how to give write access to the external 128GB MicroSD card. When I try to copy/paste  or cut/paste objects from one location to the other I am being told I need to choose the root folder of the resource (external MicroSD card) and give it write permissions. But  no where is it clear as to how to do this. At least it is not obvious how to do so. One feature I would like to see is  the ability to copy/cut/paste files from my home network's computer  NAS  etc.  over WiFi to my Android device as well. Other then that  wonderful and simple file manager. A big thank you.

Review 2: Very Basic Feature For Any File Management System Is A BUG Here ! Yeah! You've Fixed The Copying Issue Perfectly. I'm Impressed ? . But The Only Reason Behind 2 Stars & Uninstalling Application Is That- CUT Option Is Just Name  Bcoz Actually It Does COPY OPERATION. About Rest Of The Things  Proud To See This MADE IN INDIA Application Has Comparatively Better Logical Interface Than Others Like Solid Explorer Classic Which Have Over Hyped Interface (Consisting Unnecessary Elements & Icons). & BEST PART OF THE AMAZE IS LOWEST RAM CONSUMPTION ?...

Review 3: Beautiful UI  Throughput Speeds Need Improvement I have been a loyal ES File Manager fan for a long time. After getting spam notifications from it  I had to unfortunately ditch it. I've tried Amaze before  but went back to ES. No more. Going to be using Amaze for a few months and really evaluate it well. However  I have to say I love the UI. I love the ease of use. Great work devs! I have seen benchmarks that put it quite a few steps below ES as far as read/write speeds. Hopefully this can be improved as more people move away from ES.

Review 4: Still a long way to go Incredible app with lots of potential  needs to improve in areas like copying  moving files. It can be more interactive during file transfer  copying  moving (please have a look at ASUS file manager). In Android 5.1 lollipop sometimes moving multiple files makes them disappear. Please ensure stability especially while moving  copying files. Please provide sidebar with quick navigation  means you can slide the bar very fast and release it to the alphabet you want  like you do in contacts app.

Review 5: only had it for a few minutes so far  but so far I love it! simple to use and quick to learn and setup how you want it  even has a dark theme and custom colour settings! Instantly decided to make this my main file explorer especially since EZ File Explorer is trying so hard to burn its self to the ground. Only thing I can think of that is missing is the ability to add bookmarks to folders on the android home screen/descktop. I have a couple folders I access regularly that are buried in the android/data folders.

Review 6: I got sick and tired of ES file explorer hiding recently added files and jacking things up so added one after another file manager until I liked this one then deleted ES. So far  so good. Easy to find my items  accesses my sd card  I even was able to change the colors so it is easy on the eyes. I am still able to edit my documents on my phone. *maybe that is a different app that does that  no clue!* Anyway  I am a happy camper again. Looking forward to the usage of this app! Thanks  Amaze!

Review 7: Core function problems I really like how this app is clearly meant to work. I love the open source code. And the tabs. And how it opens really fast and feels lightweight.... But it wasn't even able to properly cut/paste. Most of the time the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""paste"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" icon wouldn't even appear after cut. When it did appear  the paste would fail more often than not. I'm on an S7 Edge. I also would have liked to see cloud support for services such as Dropbox and Google drive.""""

Review 8: I really like this app so far except for one issue. I want to listen to an audio file whilst doing other things on my device  but the audio stops playing as soon as I try using another app. Even if Amaze is still open in the background it won't continue playing unless I'm using Amaze directly. Is there a way to fix this? I'd certainly rate this five stars otherwise. The audio I want to listen to is on an external device otherwise I would just use the built-in music player on my device.

Review 9: Looks great Suggestion  1.cloud support  2. Image browsing need to support gesture  instead of 1 at a time. 3. Remove text editor  it can not auto detect encoding  have problem with large file  and never as powerful as pure text editor  which has syntax highlighting  replace  auto complete etc. If u want to enhance txt editor  try with over 1mb novels  and replace func incliding \n. We'd better have edit/view mode switch  and coding/novel text mode switch  but is it necessary?

Review 10: It is a simple light app that does the job. I didnt want one with the excess bloat so this is exactly what i was looking for. I sent a feedback to the developer and got a response the same morning! Wow! Only additional feature i would like to see is the ability to view pictures in a folder like a gallery (ability to swipe between photos). Currently it simply opens the one picture in the photo viewer app of your choice so it doesnt allow you to swipe to the next photo.",5379,Amaze is a file manager app for Android.

com.android.keepass,Negative,"Review 1: This is an essential suite for any user -- desktop & mobile. I use Dropbox to keep one file updated for all platforms. THIS version has two major failings however. The first is that while the desktop version(s) use a file: DATABASE.KDB as the default  this mobile version insists on looking for a file called KEEPASS.KDB instead.. The second is the slavish devotion to a SANS-SERIF font! Without serifs you cannot distinguish a lower case L from an upper case i! And if your password uses either one  you're in for some grief. I suppose a third issues is that no matter how often you use this  it NEVER remembers where the password file is  or what it's called. Having this (and other things) employ the fingerprint security would be a huge plus  but not deal-breaking.

Review 2: Be careful  this app used to clear clipboard when the app closes  it no longer does. So when you use it to copy and paste a password  it stays in your clipboard. Why should you care? Well  try pasting in any app hours after you close keepass and you will still see your password. Since clipboard is not secure  other apps on your phone can now see your password. I checed their help log and someone brought this up over 4 months ago and the problem persists. For a security app  this is very dangerous.

Review 3: OK  so bad news for me - no support of external SD cards (yes  I keep my DB on external SD  my key on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""internal"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" SD). Didn't triggered permission request. Well  thankfully I could use Android Picker to select the file through some of the file managers I use. Stock Lollipop. BTW  Look&feel needs some significant changes -it's no Gingerbread era anymore  and displays happen to be larger than 320x240  3"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" beauties. Uninstalled.""""

Review 4: Copy/paste passwords apps are not safe. Details clearly state that it clears the clipboard after your selected time interval has elapsed. It certainly DOES NOT. This is a well known issue for all Android apps. On my S5  opening Polaris Office and using the paste function shows my clipboard  nothing is cleared. Look for yourself. Passwords are visible in clear text & accessible by virtually any other app on your phone. Dev  just delete the false claim already  okay?

Review 5: Unfortunate Unfortunately  I can't open any password files with the program. Google may have screwed the Dev on this one with their ever changing file nonsense  so I refuse to give it a bad rating. Plus it's free and ad free. Can't believe you demanding assholes. What have you made and given away besides your flatulence & self righteous opinion? The world owes you all for existing I suppose. Anyway  I'm sure it'll be fixed eventually.

Review 6: I use keepassX so it is great to have this available  but there are some serious problems. In particular  one that bothers me now is the fact that both the database and key file can only come from Dropbox. This entirely obviates the security of a separate key file because they would both be lost together if your Dropbox account was compromised. It should be possible to put the key file directly on the device.

Review 7: Just like everyone else who stores the db file on Google Drive and it does not work anymore. Interestingly  after I moved the db file to dropbox and it works from there. I have no ideas what Google did do to this db file on Google Drive. It probably is a Google problem instead of KeePassDroid. However  only KeePassDroid can find the work around on Google Drive. I do not think Google would help here.

Review 8: Good on phones  broken on Chromebooks KeepassDroid has been my favorite password app on Android for years. Sadly it doesn't work on my ASUS Chromebook Flip which supports Android apps. KeepassDroid installs on the Chromebook  opens my database and displays the list of passwords. But when I tap an entry to edit or view details all I get is an empty black window. Still broken in the latest version.

Review 9: This app is okay  but as others have already stated  there is a bug whereby it doesn't remember the location of my keepass database (Google drive). I must navigate to the file every time I want to open it. This bug is a deal breaker to be honest. The file location is correct but it doesn't open unless I manually browse to the DB. Please fix this. I will be uninstalling until the bug is addressed

Review 10: Basically works but inconvenient to use and does not play nicely with dropbox  Have to type a long password each time I use it which is annoying on a mobile device. Would be good to have a simpler way of accessing the DB. Also  when using a kdb file in a dropbox folder  the app does not show the latest changes. Seems to be using an older kdb file even though dropbox clearly has the newer file.",4778,Keepass is an essential suite for any user -- desktop & mobile.

com.android.keepass,Positive,"Review 1: This app is easy to use and I love it. It may be a bit hard to understand at first  but once you learn it  you can be as productive as possible. I've seen other KeePass apps that open databases  some that come with custom keyboards that you use a button to type a password in. I don't like that  because I have a hardware keyboard on my tablet  and I'd like not to waste screen space with an on-screen keyboard. This app takes an approach I've not seen; when you leave the app on an entry  it puts """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Copy password"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Copy username"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" notifications  so it even works with apps besides browsers! I personally see this as a genius idea and I love the app. Especially since I use the app OneDriveSync  this makes the transition between PC and tablet seamless. Only one problem I see: you can't set an icon for an entry or group. Or at least  I haven't figured it out yet. I was very happy to see that it displayed icons and this is  again  a feature that most apps lack. Great app overall  I love it.""""

Review 2: Used this product for over a year perfectly! I get annoyed  at times  at an inability to edit KeePass databases but understand and appreciate that its for security. (Don't remove this security feature for convenience please!) This has been a flawless app for me to maintain accounts between PC and Android. I recently had an issue with Google Drive not loading KeePass as the default app. I sent an email to Brian and  within 24 hours  I had a response and link to the resolution to the problem! This type of quality product and that type of quality customer support is what makes a good app! Keep it up!

Review 3: Cross-platform and secure This app and it's developers deserve the high praise it receives. This app and it's Linux and Windoze counterparts form the only truly cross-platform solution for secure password storage that I know of. Sorry! IMHO web-based solutions don't inspire confidence. Not mine anyway. I've been using it on all three platforms (Win  Linux  Android) for years and it is rock-solid and seemlessly loads the encrypted master file  regardless of which device I'm using. I don't care if it's not the prettiest UI. What matters is that it works and it's secure. Well done developpers!

Review 4: Almost Perfect This PM for keypass is wonderful. It has every basic service you'd expect for security like timing out the database or clipboard. It lets you adjust these settings too. Why almost perfect? The design doesn't feel like most apps today  but more importantly there's no easy way to automate syncing databases. Like others have said using a cloud service like dropbox is the only way to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sync"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" their passwords. While a desktop is easy to have dropbox update  Android's dropbox is a little more cumbersome to update.""""

Review 5: Everyone should have KeePass to secure their passwords and other critical information. And if you have an Android device  you need to get KeePassDroid too. After all  you probably need that critical information with you throughout the day. KeePass + KeePassDroid along with Dropbox or some other Cloud storage will keep your passwords as secure as possible  but available when you need them. No more weak passwords because you'll never need to type them in by hand again  much less remember them. P.S. The latest update to the interface looks great.

Review 6: No need for other! I used lastpass for my online passwords & keypass for offline. I'm now exporting all lastpass information to keypass. The great thing  it's available for Linux (debian). Recomendation: In the future  might consider adding the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""generate secure password"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature  since almost any phone now a day can handle good values of entropy and generate decent robust passwords""""

Review 7: Great software  outdated interface Great software. I used it for the last couple of years on my PC. It even runs on a flash drive/memory stick. Saved my butt countless times. Only gripe is the old school interface. Takes me back to the eighties when we were hacking the command line in DOS. Strangely the PC has a better interface than the mobiles and even that is old compared to todays standards.

Review 8: Perfect! Literally  best in class  top of the line and open source (a MUST) 20+ years as an IT tech and still today this is the most well-known  vetted and secure method of storing your passwords on computers. This is a flawless port for Android. It hooks into the same database and secret key file that ALL my devices use. Thousands of passwords! Literally never had a single bug! Good work devs!

Review 9: Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Been using Keepass for years. Outstanding open source application. Trust has to be revealed through open source or don't use any password tool. Encryption of the storage file is a must. Keepass offers all of that and more. 5 stars not enough. Best of all it's totally free. Brian  can you please always let us know what the updates are about? Thanks for your hard work.. :-)

Review 10: Lifesaver Love the app - makes password management super easy! Have mine backed up to Dropbox so I can always retrieve file even if I lose my actual phone.

com.angrydoughnuts.android.alarmclock,Negative,"Review 1: Hi. First of all let me thank you for the continued support of the Alarm Klock application. I've been happily using it for many years. However  I'm very unhappy about the new UI. Everything is more complicated now. Consider changing the time of the alarm (which is something I do often): previously you clicked the alarm and you could start changing the time. Now you have to long-click the alarm  then click the time  an only then you can change it. Why make it more complicated? What's the purpose? Other problems: - maximum volume-increase interval is now 60 seconds. In the old app I used 90 seconds and I was happy about it. Why did this had to be disabled? What's so wrong about 90 seconds? - the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""increase/decrease by 1 minute"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" buttons are missing. You now have to fiddle with the system keyboard to achieve this. Inconvenient. - icons are used instead of texts. App looks """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cooler"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but it's harder to determine which option does what. Again  inconvenient. I use Android Marshmallow and the old UI worked perfectly for me. The new UI adds nothing  removes some functionality and makes other functionality harder to use. Please  please  PLEASE consider bringing the old UI back!""""

Review 2: Aesthetically """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""better GUI""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""? awful usability! Please reverse the changes (if you want keeping """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""material look"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but not changing what was the best and functional alarm around ?.

Review ~1996 (5 stars): Now with fixed slider the GUI isn't nice  but it's simply the best alarm in what is important: functionality  speed & ease of use""""

Review 3: Used to be great but no longer reliable & needs urgent fix! This WAS ONCE a really good basic alarm app without unnecessary gimmicks or permissions. But for almost a year now  there have been serious problems which haven't been fixed: (1) Snoozing the alarm more than once FAILS - as others describe  it counts down to the snooze time but then instead of ringing it resets to the next main alarm time. This is a FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM  because an alarm must be 100% reliable  or it isn't reliable at all. (2) It doesn't always override my SGS3 lock screen  so I have to enter the unlock pattern before I can snooze or cancel an alarm. It's very disappointing that these problems have been reported by me & others for many months but still persist.

Review 4: Good app - but please fix bugs Love the fade-in volume. BUG: if u edit alarm time by typing #s instead of +/- 5 or 1 buttons  then changes are NOT retained after 'OK' & 'OK'. Also  REQUEST: Option for larger Label text  as it appears on ringing alarm screen. When u have several alarms  showing *which* one is ringing cud be clearer. ALSO: Re 'Snooze' prob reported by others: alarm fails randomly (plays sys. default or nothing) if I use media on Ext.SD  so I only use *internal* SD now. Test this pls? Maybe system lag when in lo pwr mode?

Review 5: Is it just me? This app used to work like a dream for me  but since the UI update things just aren't right. The app crashes when I select certain albums from the list and I can't find any discernible reason for the crashes  as all the files are the same format. I used to assume it was the files I purchased through iTunes that wouldn't work  but some of my more recent purchases work while the rest just make the app crash. It's upsetting because all the songs that would be great to wake up to are simply impossible to set.

Review 6: New UI completely ruined it! Not only the new version has a bug that's causing it to crash like other reviews say  but also the new UI is far worse. Bring back 1/5 minute adjustment with arrows without having to use the keyboard. Bring back single tap on the alarm to edit it and tap on the box to enable / disable it instead of having to hold the finger on it. Why change something that worked perfectly for years and was the very reason I chose this alarm app? I'm looking for an alternative now  you lost a customer.

Review 7: Update broke it Sorry  but version 1.9 was excellent. Update to 2.0 and 2.1 broke it since now sometimes the alarm is muted. Not good for something that is supposed to wake you up. The alarm volume seems to be tied media volume and not alarms. Since most of the time my media volume is very low and at night I use do not disturb  the alarm does not sound. This seems like it should not be very difficult to fix. I will reinstall when this is fixed. I also don't prefer the long press to edit  it was better before.

Review 8: USED TO BE GOOD - PLEASE FIX! I used to love this app! It's stability was amazing. Even the the phone hard rebooted the alarm would come right back. Now with the latest version  this thing consumes a MASSIVE amount of CPU and battery even when no alarms are set. So much so that I had to uninstall it - my phone went from fast to being unusable it was so bogged down. When browsing around with this app supposedly closed and no alarms set  it used more CPU & battery than just about all other processes combined.

Review 9: Please listen to your loyal users Your app was much better than the well known alarm apps  and this is why it had such a high rating  then you ruined the things we love with this new awful UI - do you not notice that the ratings since the last update are all bad? - please revert to old UI or at least release the old version as seperate app with a name such as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Alarm Klock Classic"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - we are even willing to pay for the old one  but just don't take it away when we depend on it!""""

Review 10: New version is useless I have been a looong time user of this app and loved it for its simplicity and clean look. Now it's not. And not even an working alarm clock(?). My old alarms did not work after the update  got late for work(thanks for that one). You can not any longer set an alarm in the same hour the time is for the moment!? So if you want to take a 30min nap in the middle of the day on the same hour  that won't be possible! Sorry to say  but seems the creator lost it all in one version update :(",6537,The new version of the Alarm Klock app crashes when you try to use it. The alarm fails to ring if you snooze the alarm more than once. The app doesn't always override my SGS3 lock screen so I have to enter the unlock pattern before I canSnooze or cancel an alarm.
com.angrydoughnuts.android.alarmclock,Positive,"Review 1: DHLWinterParkFL Update: I  too  have been frustrated when the snooze feature failed. Here is my simple workaround until they fix it: set two (or more  if you prefer) separate alarms at 10-minute intervals. Alarm Klock's flexibility allows you to set as many consecutive alarms as you want. Wouldn't be without this app. It is the most flexible  reliable  adaptable alarm clock I have found. My Android phone had to be reset  and this is one of the first apps I am reinstalling. Gotta' wake up on time  dontcha know?

Review 2: Great Again! I was a loyal user for years. I loved the simplicity of the UI and customization options for each alarm you set up. I had to delete this app when my Samsung S5 updated to Android 6.0 because the snooze function stopped working. Months later I noticed my once favorite alarm app had been updated but also saw many bad reviews. I threw caution in the wind and installed it anyways. Good thing I did! Snooze is now working and I even like the new UI. I'll update if things change but so far so good.

Review 3: Have used this happily for three years now  but recently noticed that using snooze actually turns off the alarm completely on Lollipop HTC One M8. I will continue to use this alarm since I have it configured to notify me of my schedule changes throughout the day  and all the other features still work very well. At night  though  I will set two alarms for the morning rather than using snooze. I do hope that this gets fixed. Thank you very much to the developer!

Review 4: No problems for me with Ver2 Seems to be lots of moaning about the update to version2 but its works just fine on my Galaxy S6. Will take me a while to get used to long press to adjust alarms but it all looks straightforward to me. Loved the old version and this looks just as good. All alarms Ive set so far worked perfectly ok (and snoozed correctly) and thats the key thing. Thank for continuing to develop this useful tool

Review 5: Used to love it  could love it again. Hate the new alarm settings menu! Please bring back the old. Why did you guys change something that worked great? I've used this app for years  but will be looking for something else if you can't undo this. ***UPDATE*** Now using Alarm Clock Xtreme (paid version) by AVG Labs. Not as good as Alarm Klock used to be  but a thousand times better than the current version.

Review 6: On Nexus 5 I've been using this as my main alarm for 5 years now on various phones and never had an issue with it. There was a warning about malware last time I downloaded but I've checked the forums and the code and there is no issue. This app works great and has never let me down. Craig if you're ever my way I owe you a beer. FYI. To optimise any new software always a good idea to reboot.

Review 7: Fantastic and simple app that does what it should: wake you up Love the app! And have been using it for years and years! However  with the new update  I'm experiencing that my alarms are soundless when my phone are on mute  which it is pretty much all the time  Which again makes it a little bit useless for me right now at the moment but hopefully there will be a fix

Review 8: I've always used this app and always loved it 5 stars all the way  loses a star for making me relearn how to use it boohoo  still no ads why does he do it... Will give it 5 stars again after I've got used to the changes ? OK I've took time to relearn and it's 5 stars again (didn't take long) will also check out your GitHub page  thanks for this (Ad)free app.

Review 9: This is by far my favorite alarm clock. I've tried so many in the past  but this one is just simple and perfect. No bs involved  not drowning in ads  but my favorite thing is the touch to snooze and swipe to end the alarm. With the swipe I never accidentally turn it off sleep in too late. I've had it on my last 3 phones and I highly recommend it.

Review 10: Better than stock  wish it was more reliable Sometimes """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Snooze"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" shuts the alarm off  or it never goes off in the first place. On a Motorola Photon. MUCH better than the stock app  but I would be much happier if this was like a Ronco product  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Set it and forget it"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". ;)""""",4238,Alarm Klock's flexibility allows you to set as many consecutive alarms as you want.

com.app.missednotificationsreminder,Positive,"Review 1: This is a great app. Simple to set up and use. Like one other reviewer mentioned  I agree that is lacking one feature. At present  you can set the time interval between notification signals (i.e. 30 seconds  1 minute  2 minutes  etc.) But it does not let you set the total duration of the notifications. As it is  if the notifications start  they do not end until the user opens the email  text  etc. If someone leaves their phone and goes off without it  family members have to listen to the notification signals indefinitely. It would be nice to have the ability to set a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""duration"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" time on the notifications  so that after a specified time (X number of minutes)  the periodic notifications would stop.

com.artifex.mupdfdemo,Positive,"Review 1: fast and light It's the already open and poured 2% milk to their buttermilk. It isn't as feature rich  (or tangy?) but is such a relief to use for quick references. It loads so quickly  I sometimes forget it isn't already running. It does have TOC  reflow  and a few other simpler capabilities. It's lean first and foremost. It's no full fledged epub reader  and even failed to load one for me. I wouldn't go without it  though  and it is my go-to viewer for PDFs  for its awesome responsiveness.

Review 2: As Basic As It Gets  But Lightning Fast If you're the kind of person who likes minimalism and prefers function over form  you'll love MuPDF. It sacrifices pretty much everything for the sake of speed  and does a damn good job of it too. Those looking for a simple  fast PDF reader without any fancy bells and whistles will find this app a godsend. What's more  unlike Google PDF  it even has an app icon for quickly opening recently viewed files. :)

Review 3: Fastest PDF reader I've seen for Android up till now. Great performance even on low-end tablets. Simple but effective flow for reading: Tapping on the right side of the document either advances to the next page or  if you are zoomed in  moves to the next unread part of the page. Perfect for Calibre Companion users bzw. Also: No Ads  no in-app purchases. Software is open source  code is available from Artifex (makers of Ghostscript).

Review 4: The fastest and lightest ever made Simply the best lightweight PDF reader for Linux  Windows and Android. A pity that there is no annotation/highlighting feature  even a minimal one would be very useful. Moreover  screen always on should be added. With these features it would be possible to fully replace other much heavier and more complex readers

Review 5: Guys  your app is probably the fastest and lightest reader on the play store and it is awesome. But please....please!! change the interface. I'm not telling you to adapt material design or something. I mean  to open a file  we have to locate it each and every time on the storage!? WTF? Fix this and I'll give you 5 stars

Review 6: Fastest out of the PDF readers I tried. Makes all the difference when flipping through content-heavy pdfs like roleplaying sourcebooks that features lots of high resolution images. Together with support for bookmarks and being free it is essentially all I'll ever need.

Review 7: Best tradition of independent SW Neat  fast  simple  and the only other package I have seen to give equal clarity seems to invoke this one. APPLAUSE! Oh yes  add in edit  cleanly handles PDFs that some other good readers choke on.

Review 2: Don't do it! If you install this  it tells you that you have a limited set of stats unless you're rooted... Once you root the phone and install this it gives you the option of installing as a System App to enable the use of the other features... If you say yes to this  understand there's absolutely no way that I've found to easily remove this app from the phone and it is granted complete access to the system. I've reached out to the developer to ask for help uninstalling the app and will update this review if he can provide me with an easy way to get it off.

Review 3: Gotta say  I expected a lot better After reading reviews and internet articles everyone seemed to agree this was the go to battery app. I couldn't disagree more. The navigation inside the app is terrible. UI feels unfinished. Everything is done via drop down menus. No gestures  side drawers or tabs. Lack of visuals make massive amounts of text info an extreme eye sore. Graphs are minimal and largely unhelpful. Overall  not an inviting app by any means. Make good use of the20 min refund period as there is NO free version of this available.

Review 4: Nougat support at all possible? Great app that hasn't seen an update since October 2015 unfortunately. Not the most user friendly and has a pretty steep learning curve but once you get the hang of things it provides an amazing amount of invaluable data for optimizing one's device  a must have app for those with battery drain problems. Hope we're getting an update soon as it doesn't bode well for an application's future when updates stop coming. Would be a shame to see this tool fall by the wayside like so many other once top notch tools.

Review 5: Does not install on Lollipop I am sure my phone is correctly rooted (for many other apps it works)  I have granted root permissions  but the app cannot be installed as a system app. Then I am sent to a website to download a recovery zip  but there are actually two links  one of them to an older version with an empty system folder and the other one seems to be ok by its contents (but it has only 300KB  weird considering that the app itself is more than 3MB at the Play Store).

Review 7: Too difficult Failed at installing locally due to Google changes to Android 4.4+ something something about binary. I can't be bothered to download zips that fail install and have no clear instructions. I'm not a root power user I just wanted an app that leverages root for better battery readings. Sadly this is not it  waste of $2. To dev; I have r that means you should include all necessary workarounds within your app not send me on a goosehunt for other downloads simply to make your app work. Fail.

Review 8: Not as good as WLD This app is good (4 stars)  but it is not as good as Wakelock Detector. Make sure you check out both before you PAY for this. I personally prefer WLD. In fact  you should try WLD first  since the FREE version has ALL the features except widgets and Knowledge Base articles. I find it very I disappointing that BBS does not offer a trial version. I bought it because I was hoping that it would give me further insight than WLD. It didn't  really. If I could  I would get a refund.

Review 9: Zip app doesn't work For reasons discussed by you the app does not work with the latest updates. Upon downloading the zip app I initially had trouble  finding it impossible to press the install button even. After restarting my phone the button worked  but did not install.

If this is fixed I can give a proper review  because as of now I have paid ~£2 for an app that doesn't work.""""

Review 10: Great app  terrible UI  inconsistent results. This app is a great STARTING POINT to increased battery life... But nearly every feature is a crap-shoot if it reports correctly (yes stats while charging is disabled).

com.asksven.betterbatterystats,Positive,"Review 1: Amazing  and I mean amazing(!) app if rooted. Still somewhat useful  (even if not) 4.4 KitKat and later OS KitKat and later reduced the utility of this app almost indescribably: If not routed now  you are seeing less than a tenth of what this app can do. Still  even now  unlike most great  pre-KK system diagnostic apps that are barely usable  it is still useful for sleep to awake tracking and list of system processes. If you're rooted  it's the holy grail of power leach finders: it gets right to the heart of the issue  and fast. No significant battery load either. If rooted  it is an absolute must have.

Review 2: Great app by a great dev. Use this in combination with greenify donation package and my phone last for 3 days on a charge easily. I have a one plus 3t running rooted stock mm OS and after using better battery stats to track down some pesky wakelocks I average no less than 9hr SOT on a full charge. If I don't use my phone for much of anything other than texts phone calls and some light social media and web browsing I can easily get 3days out of a full charge. Highly recommend this for anyone looking to get some serious use time out of their device.

Review 3: Great! Update: causing wakelock Does what it's supposed to so five stars! Better layout than gsam so if your trying to choose out if the two  get this! Update: started having problems with the screen not turning off by itself. Wakelock detector showed that better battery stats was causing the wakelock. It was the watchdog feature that for some reason was keeping the screen awake. With that disabled it is now working again. To be honest I don't really need this app. Running viperone 8.0.0 with elememtalx kernel and battery is amazing!

Review 4: A must-have for rooted phones The one thing that it really needs is some sort of fast and simple way to get more information about what a given wakelock actually is. A lot of the wakelock names are not very explicit and clear about what they are and requires Googling it to learn more about it. If the app would make this aspect far more streamlined--like giving the option for a wakelock entry to do a Google search for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Android wakelock [wakelock name]""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  then I'd definitely give this app 5 stars.""""

Review 5: This is a great diagnostic app! If you really want to know what is going on  and which apps are eating your battery for breakfast lunch and dinner when its only mid morning? Well then look no farther  because now you can do something about it. In stead of just killing off other active apps why not learn to adjust settings to accomplish the mission. Better battery health and longevity! Oh and the miniscule cost is nothing compared to the amount of work that went into making this great app! Or you can get a free battery killer!

Review 6: Must Have App!!! If you are running a bunch of apps  no matter what phone you have  you'll be able to squeeze every ounce of juice out of your phone with premium efficiently. The graphs seem to be broken as of Kitkat but is still amazingly useful and downright required for monitoring and tracking those pesky social media apps and other hidden things running in the background. It isn't the easiest thing to snag and use right out of the box so do yourself a favor and look up a guide on how to use this amazing tool effectively

Review 7: Informative  sorta. It's a geek's tool that lets one see what is really using your battery. There's a bit of a learning curve to sort out what's what. That's worth it as it provides a LOT of info towards diagnosing battery-drain issues  or just satisfying curiosity. When I first started using this program it was my phone's top internet-using application according to it's own stats. I don't know if that would calm down once enough of the Knowledge Base was cached but I disabled Google Analytics and Knowledge Base stuff in

Review 8: Exactly does what its supposed to do I had serious battery drainage problems and I couldn't find the cause of it  I tried different apps but non of them helped me as much as this app did. HOWEVER  you should keep this in mind that this app works best when you have a rooted phone. You may also consider using this in conjunction with androids battery stat (in your settings) to be able to solve your battery drainage problems. I would've 5 stars if it had a knowledge base built-in so you don't have to Google wakelocks.

Review 9: Saved my battery many times over! An essential app if you want to keep an eye on your battery usage and you're technical enough to understand it. Well  you don't really need to be a hacker to use this  but it sure helps to have some technical knowledge so that you may use the information this wonderful app gives: with this information I could track down processes that were keeping my phone in wakelocks and drastically improved my batter life. Thank you! :). Also  please make a paid version. I wanna pay :D.

Review 10: BestBatteryStats Pretty much everything you could want if you're looking for an app that actually does what it says (monitor your battery) without trying to cram in enough worthless features that your battery is worse off than when you started (every other app it seems like ).

Review 2: Lots of features  not very polished Podax has an impressive feature list  but daily usage is clunky and bug prone. Managing episodes in subscriptions is awkward. Also when the cell or wifi connection is spotty  Podax's background service hangs and freezes the app. These are bugs that could be fixed  but overall the app looks very dated and is not so user friendly.

Review 3: I'm looking for a replacement for Podax After using this app ever since Listen stopped working I really hoped this app would mature. But it has Terrible performance issues that affect the entire phone's performance in the background  vital missing options and a heap of annoying bugs.

Review 4: Keeps redownloading the same podcasts on mobile data I have unselected and removed the podcast and even set it to WiFi only download but it's still obstinately running on mobile data. This needs to be fixed immediately!

com.axelby.podax,Positive,"Review 1: Best of features  worst of bug Has all the features I need  many I want; but adds all episodes of every podcast to download queue and stores them to main memory. No other apps can run  you can't choose which episodes are downloaded. So close.

Review 2: Great podcatcher Set up your subscriptions and forget. Been using this for nearly 2 years and love it. Love to support the developer but unfortunately I don't use any of his payment methods. A donate version works be awesome to support him

Review 3: Great but crashes too often. I switched to podax after Google Listen was sunset. This app is great  it has everything I need. Easily would give it 5 stars if it did not crash so frequently.

Review 2: Best Coin Flipping App I took the time to download the top listed coin flipping apps to determine which was the best  and this one is certainly the winner. 1)Most app contained an ad box and/or internet permission (for updated adds)  but this one does not. 2)This is also the only app I noticed which allows you to run a diagnostic test  ensuring that the flips are both 50% likely (the whole point of the app). 3)This app just looked sleekest and simplest  and even included an option to turn flip graphics off (faster results).

Review 3: OMFG This is a huge amount of fun. It baffles me to see that people get closed-source  ad-laden programs where clean  elegant  open-source alternatives exist. This gentleman obviously does something creative with computers for a living. It reminds me of the time my roommate's brother-in-law fixed our boom-box. He was an electrical engineer at one of the national nuclear labs  and the result was consequently way better than it needed to be. Thanks for a fun (and suspiciously perfect) app! :)

com.better.alarm,Negative,"Review 1: Not the best! Edit to Yuriy: how rude can you be?!? Let me speak in small words so you can understand. There is only a small amount (like around 5) of alarm sounds. My volume was up  and it was still very soft. Yes I was clicking on the button for it to snooze and it would not stop! This app sucks and does not work for my needs. From the 1st alarm that went off  I've had problems. The volume is not very loud at all  there is very minimal alarm choices for alarm sounds to choose from  and when alarm goes off  it takes anywhere from 3-5 mins for snooze to take affect  by that time your wide awake  and then doesn't even go off again when set snooze time is up! not good at all. I do not recommend for anybody!

Review 2: impressive! it's easy to use. however  i think hour and minute should be edit separately. for example: i was set alarm to 16.32 and i want to change to 16.45 i should be able to edit the minute instead of type all hour and minute 1645. this app didn't auto power on the device (good) like the lenovo's alarm did which is really annoyed me and i have to find a good alarm like this.

Review 3: Worst alarm clock  doesn't switch off! As mentioned by several others  this stupid thing completely freezes when it goes off so you can't snooze it or dismiss it  it's there going off with nothing you can do other than remove the battery! Yeah  because you really want to be doing that when you've just woken up at 5.30am! Uninstalled  load of rubbish.

Review 4: Useful alarm but not for me! Changed as realised the issue isn't with the app but with the LG g3  since upgrading to lollipop it is impossible  from what i can tell from my many attempts at fixing this  to use a sound alarm while phone is in silent mode! Otherwise the app does work perfectly!

Review 5: It was a 5 star app and then... Love this app... But recently  snooze stopped working. I almost missed work because the alarm did not go off after the initial alarm. I think it began around the time I updated my system software. If it's fixed  this will be a 5 star app again!

Review 6: PRRRRFECT! I'd pay for THIS ONE! Exactly what I wanted: simple...not all of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""extras"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" that make OTHER alarm clocks  the so called """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""simple alarms"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so cluttered  complicated and just...plain...crappy! !""""

Review 7: Disappointed It may be a an issue across the board but it was fine until the alarms stopped working. Defeats the purpose of having it. I tried reinstalling which made no difference. Alarm only went off after I unlocked my screen and even at that there was a lag.

Review 8: Glitch If you are using your tablet and the alarm rings  it shows itself as a small area. If you touch """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""snooze""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  it does snooze  but if you touch """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" dismiss""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  it does nothing and you can't shut it off""""

Review 9: I really like this app. However  I was disappointed because it was not letting me use a music that I own as my alarm music. Is there any way that I can set my a mp3 music as the alarm music? Besides the lack of the feature  it is the perfect app.

com.better.alarm,Positive,"Review 1: Perfectly Simple It's been completely reliable. It's nice that I can pick from 3 color themes and the alarm is very simple.

Review 2: Love this alarm clock! I had been looking for a new alarm clock ever since my old one stopped getting support. I installed the premium version of Simple Alarm Clock  but then uninstalled and got a refund once I realized that it is not as up to date and it doesn't keep my alarms from the free version... I would have to reconfigure them all. An in-app purchase to unlock the premium version would be a welcome feature. Fix this and I'll gladly pay for it and give 5 stars. Also  please add feature to """"""""""""""""skip-once"""""""""""""""" an individual alarm.""""

Review 3: Good basic.. This alarm clock is very dependable. There's no way to delete a bunch of the old alarms without doing it one by one. Also if you want to pick an alarm to go off 3 days from whatever day you happen to be at you don't have the choice of being able to do it for just that one day on Wednesday or Thursday without it repeating itself every Wednesday or Thursday or whatever day you pick. It would be very useful to be able to sort the alarms so that active ones are all together one after the other

Review 4: simple to use  no clutter there are tons of alarm clock apps.. i have tried at least 10. it seems that everyone has forgotten what am alarm clock should do.. wake you up! the others are offering so many extra features that the main function gets lost and it's easy to make a mistake when setting up the alarm. this one is the only one that is easy to set up  has beautiful design  no bloatware.. just works... I would be happy to pay for it.. but """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""unfortunately"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it's free :)""""

Review 5: Works good This alarm is effective and reliable easy to use one suggestion I would have is some way to have an alarm go off a couple days in the future but not have it repeat that day every single week unless you want it to repeat every week Also trying to delete alarms once your queue becomes full could be improved by clicking all the alarms you want removed at once. Is there a way to add a function so that you can choose to delete the alarm when it gives you the option to snooze or dismiss?

Review 6: Great Alarm app.. No ads  very simple alarm clock app. It works perfect for me and only takes up 3.27MB of storage on my Galaxy S3. The only thing thing this app needs is the ability to dismiss upcoming alarms. I use a lot of alarms for reminders and would like to be able to dismiss them before the scheduled time sometimes. I would highly recommend this app! Will give 5 stars if dismiss alarm early option is added.

Review 7: Was great Was working great 5star  Till update. Installed 1/21/15 release after uninstalling prior version as suggested in read me. Now no more alarm screen before unlock  cannot snooze or dismiss from notify screen (shows options but does not do any)  only way to stop alarm was to manually launch app and un-check the alarm. Busted... I did uninstall and reinstall a second time with same results. Samsung S3.

Review 8: Very easy to use bug free Dose what it says on the tin. works well easy lots of options. almost perfect. This is not complaints more suggestions snooze  alarm silence and fade in times to allow a user amount or at least smaller denominations say 1 or 2 mins. movement of phone snooze been using this app for along time well over 2 years.. thats the only things I would improve. very well done

Review 9: The best one out of dozens After the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Alarm Clock Plus"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" started not ringing right  I found myself in the search for a new alarm.

com.bleyl.recurrence,Negative,"Review 1: Notification not showing once considered a non-alert - considered done  perhaps? The app I ended up choosing out of the six I tested was not the most feature-packed  but I wanted simple notification bar reminder that did not demand much space  which this one offered  but the built-in system for this one made it less useful for me  since notifications went away without my wanting them to.

com.bleyl.recurrence,Positive,"Review 1: This is a VERY good app  however... The reason why I'm only giving 3 stars is because I purchased the pro version to see what the widget looks like. To be honest  it's quite unattractive and is too big. There should be an option to customise the widget  like adjusting the opacity  size of font and reminders  and themes. I will give this app 5 stars if you add my suggestions.

Review 2: Clever Developer What i really like is the developer's way of thinking about the app. He knows what a reminder love one expects from an app. Asking user if he/she wants a mark done or snooze option in notifications is a good idea besides persistent notifications. Btw  really wonder what the next step is. Will the user be able to add pics  voice records..etc to reminders?

Review 3: Just what I've been looking for! I needed something clean  lightweight  and above all FAST. I don't need 10 taps to add a date/time (looking at you  Keep!). This app fills all of my needs perfectly  and for free! PLEASE keep the app light and snappy. I would also be more than happy to pay for a couple bonus features. As long as it's not monthly :P Awesome App

Review 4: if priority notifications are on but reminders are ticked. And during priority only Google keep vibrates.... So why doesnt this? And yes vibration is on in the settings.... It needs to have the option to make separate lists. See the app """"""""""""""""Tasks Free"""""""""""""""" and you will see what I mean. It will be a good addition""""

Review 5: Works great If you added small funtionality improvements it would be perfect; like selecting multiple reminders  for marking as done  or deleting. Perhaps also allowing for having the active and the inactive reminders in the same screen  in different styles.

Review 6: I love it! It's well designed and helps a lot with keeping me organized. HOWEVER  something I'd like to see is having reminders that don't have a notification. This would mainly be useful for the widget for things that you don't want a certain time set.

Review 7: I like it! And am using it with success. Some suggestions from me: some different icons would be good. Also I'm not sure the snooze works when you type in the numbers. But overall is a nice simple app and I like the icon and colours idea. Thanks.

Review 8: Perfect App for Reminders Loving the App so far ..the Nagging Reminder is a brilliant feature .. The only thing missing is a widget ...just something to keep a tab on your reminders ..would be great if that could be implemented in future ..

Review 9: Great  easy to use reminder app. I've tried many others but always come back to this one. Mainly because it's simple  and has all the features I want. Like being able to set stuff to repeat every few hours.

I typically add tasks for the day in the morning but it won't appear on widget cuz it defaults to next day. Thx",2954,The app is free and available on the Google Play Store. Users can set reminders to repeat every few hours or mark things as done. There is no widget for the app. Some users have given the app 5 stars. The app is not yet available on iOS.
com.boardgamegeek,Negative,"Review 1: Good application  but ... The app worked well for a bit until i had added 3 games to my collection  then i bwgan having trouble adding any other games to it. I could search and find the games i was looking for  but when navigating to the game to add it to my collection  the app would go to the game page  and then nothing would happen: no information about the game. Unfortunate  for managing my collection from my phone. Also the inability to add multiple games/expansions at the same time is an oversight to the apps functionality.

Review 2: Great EDIT: After clearing cache and data in phone settings for the app everything has sorted itself out and the app works flawlessly. For some reason it automatically changes all the letters in my username to be lowercase (I have one uppercase) and now it fails to sync. If I manually fix it in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""plays"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" then the sync and play stats work until the (I imagine) website fixes the uppercase issue and all my play stats are messed up again.""""

Review 3: Sync issues and missing info When the app works  it works well; however  the app seems to have many issues that make using the website often a better choice. I lost access to my wish list on the app  you cannot view multiple photos of a game  the UI for rating and reviewing games is almost hidden  and the search feature is useless unless you know exactly what you want to find. I use the app to log plays  but for now that's about it.

Review 4: ---~~~* A Mataeus Review *~~~--- It's a great app to use when you're out buying a new game and you want to see how it sits in the world rankings  but it suffers from the same problem as the website: It's just not user friendly enough. Also  it's taken the developer literally years to finally create the ability to add games to your collection through the app! Bloody ridiculous; but at least the option is there  now.

Review 5: The app synced once but would not sync ever again even after clearing the storage  reinstalling  and signing back in. No notification would show even when manually forcing it to sync. Tried on other similar apps and they synced fine with BGG. App is unuseable until it can sync properly. Update: seemed to sync but now app won't launch at all and just crashes. So it's unusable again.

Review 6: Great  but missing esoteric details The only thing that stops me rating this a five are small user experience things. H-index I now understand  but what are quarters  nickels and dimes? There's so much empty space on the play stats page  couldn't these be explained? I also think the plays could use totals for the groups (month or game) added to the grouping bars.

Review 7: This app has no business being this bad. Crashes when trying to add plays; Syncs only the first 8 alphabetic games I own; Won't actually load data on 90% of the games in its own library. It's a shame because the Add Plays interface looks nice and I'd absolutely use it  but sadly the web interface remains the only viable part of BGG... even as we enter 2017.

Review 8: Error messages all over the place When I try to sync plays  when I search for a game that's not in my collection  when I record a play... More often than not I get a Java error about a website query being invalid. I've tried deleting my data and resyncing several times  but each time something else breaks after a few uses. I'm getting fed up with this.

Review 9: refresh i really miss a refresh button in the title bar when im going through forums or such. when i got sometimes bad signal receptions  the app informs me that data connection is not available and i have to go backwards through forum structure to get the page refresh  which sucks a lot. can this be fixed? otherwise great work

com.boardgamegeek,Positive,"Review 1: This app has improved since version 1.0 but still needs a lot of work. The latest version looks great with material design layouts but seems to give less information. Many things are just not accessible. The play logging is great but currently does not work since you can't move to the next field or the play does not sync. I do love how it gives you a notification at each game log telling you what number play you're at for the game (the rare time it works). But what ruins the app are the syncing issues which are abundant and make the app often useless.

Review 2: Good app  keep improving it please The new look is fantastic! Nice job. Withholding that last star for collection editing. :) The app makes reading forums and seeing my collection very phone friendly. I would like to be able to add to and edit my collection though. Also  please don't show me the timeout error message until I request more information. Just because I'm not currently getting internet access  there is no reason that I shouldn't be able to finish reading what I've already downloaded. New Internet button in the forums is handy!

Review 4: Witty Title This is a great app that has gotten pretty with the last update. More information is at your fingertips  such as H index  dime and nickel counts. As with so many others the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 is the couple of missing functionalities. I'd also like to see access to lists of dimes or nickels by tapping the respective label  but i want collection modification first. Keep up the good work! PS- where can one read up on the disconnect between the play count in Plays and Play Stats?

Review 5: Good but not great... Yet. This app is definitely a must download for any board game player with an interest in keeping up to date with the BGG forums or logging plays for your current board game collection. Also is a very stable program with no crashing to date. It is however missing the ability to update your collection (and a few other options) that have been promised in future updates. At that time it will get a 5 star rating but until then only 4 stars!

Review 6: Excellent App with more features than I can use I mainly use the App for logging plays as my tablet doesn't have 3G so I don't access game info other than for my collection and rarely use the Forum reader either. I wish there was a short cut to set the winner  like there is for setting player scores - I play a lot of co-op games and setting 5 winners is a pain! The dev team are very responsive to bug reports and feature requests  which really helps

Review 7: Awesome App. It's great that the app keeps track of Quarters  Dimes and Nickles for games played. It's like achievements/trophies for video games. It would be fantastic if it also kept track of Loonies (100 games played) & Toonies (200 games played). I realize few people would reach those achievements but I have with Coup  Coup G54 and Coup G54 Anarchy. It would be a nice add for obsessive gamers like me. :)

Review 8: The drop down box still seems to only show collections. I just figured out if you go to Settings  Sync  What- you can select everything you have put in your account  including Wishlist and Want to Buy. It shows it all together with the Collection though. Would be nice if the drop down box on Collections page allowed you to filter between what you own and what you want to buy. Great App though thanks.

Review 9: Getting better Mostly issue free except for one huge one. Every time you log a play the site carries the right data but the app drops to 1 play. The only way to rectify it is to clear the data and resync your entire collection every time you log anything. Anoying. Nice layout and basically a good little filing system if you have a lot of games. Wil be great when it logs plays properly again.

Review 10: Very Nice App. Good app  but it is missing some quite a few things  such as adding new games to your collection  and posting to forums. I know the app is not this website's top priority  but if they added more of the features the site has  I would never go to the site again.

com.brentpanther.bitcoinwidget,Positive,"Review 1: The widget is minimalistic and tap to refresh is excellent (especially the visual indicator with the 3 dots)! What would make the widget perfect though is to have a 1x1 size widget  especially because it seems that the existing price indicator can fit just fine in the 1x1 space (without icon or decimals)  so it seems reasonable and I can't really afford for the widget to take space for 2 icons. I actually recommend 1x1 to be the only one because from there everybody can resize to their liking (to bigger).

Review 2: Does what it says on the tin  pretty much exactly what I wanted. Simple and clear. And the devloper managed to contain what must have been gut busting wrath at my previous review because clearly PEBKAC over at my end. Cheers all [And then I delete the review?

Review 3: Perfect minimalistic widget. Tap to refresh is excellent (especially with the visual indicator). Edit: Thanks Brent for the 1x1 size  the option to hide decimals and all the other improvements! :) Edit 2: I think the text size on device rotation issue is back after the price went to 3 digits again.

Review 4: Thanks for adding up Coins.ph  however  I'm not seeing it accurate since it's little bit lower than the actual buying price. Anyway  perhaps there's just a latency with the actual value... Keep up the good work and immediate response.. Good job!!!

Review 5: No permission needed  simple  wish it had a 1x1  tho Love that it doesn't expect me to give it a ton of permissions. Clean and simple design. My only gripe is that I'd prefer a 1x1 widget to be available  but that's really just a nitpick. Thanks!

From what I've read  this is a problem with the latest update. So how about putting it back into working order guys? Plus  you Cloud to go across devices would make it awesome!""""

Review 3: Good app but I have a few security concerns Great app. I wish it wouldn't copy text from my password manager app KeePassDroid(or could a blocked list be enabled somehow so it wouldn't show every time I copy my password?). Maybe an option for the copied text to have an option to (never remember this text again  similar to how you can star copied text you could maybe block text from showing in list). I noticed also if notifications are on it shows the text even when I have the lock screen on. This is not good if the last thing I copied was a password.

Review 4: KeePass concern. Keepass copies the username and password to the clipboard  where it is then deleted after a few seconds. But Clipstack copies the clipboard thus providing a security problem. Clipstack can't do anything about it and that's fine but I wish there was a toggle in the notification so I can easily turn it on and off  still being able to copy text from it though. Unfortunately there is no notification unless the service is on  making it tedious to switch it on and off. Still  a very well designed and useful app.

Review 5: Nice  but security is worrisome with Accessibility permission demands for some features Quite functional  but no theme support yet. I wish the developer would not ask Accessibility permission for the floating bubble. WARNING: this gives the app access to any window's content! Imagine the horror if you have a banking app opened!! I would disable the feature until the developer changes the implementation to a non-intrusive one. For now  back to using the safe and secure Clipper app.

Review 6: Has potential I downloaded the app last night. When I tried to connect my bluetooth earbuds it would not connect. I tried powering down my devices and taking the battery out of my phone ...nothing helped. Then I uninstalled the app  powered down my devices  took the battery out my phone  and powered on my phone and everything is back to normal after 1 hr of trying to resolve the issue.

Review 7: Poor There are far better apps. I don't care a bit about """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Material Design"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Back to my old standby Clipper+. The app does not work with at least one key app I use  KeePass  FAIL! - - - - Make it compatible AND have a permanent place to store common clips  then you may have a good app. Clipper Plus kicks your buns. LOL to your reply.""""

Review 8: Great! The only thing that should be noted is the fact that certain password manager like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""safe in cloud"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" use a copy and paste method to fill password fields and there is no way (at all?) to exclude data copied from such apps. Yet the data is decontextualized  so the risk should be minimum in normal situations.""""

Review 2: LOVE this app  but a yr into using it  I have so MUCH... Please implement folders/tags  or the ability to add to notebook. Maybe in copy menu: Clip-copy (is recycled) Clip-update/replace  & Clip-save launches a box with an option to Tag. Similar to &lt; to Keep. Needs a reminder to clean out clips every () week(s). Wish we could update a clip & auto archive its history  rather than having SEVERAL copies of a clips progression. Would be really AWESOME if you could set a default to background monitor  capture  & auto-save ALL typed data  regardless of app  to Clipstack. Making captured data recoverable  in the event of an app/device crash! I try to remember to Select-all /Copy every few min  but sometimes I forget & lose HOURS of work in posts  messages  etc. Leaves me wanting to KILL somebody!

Review 3: I was Lost before Clip Stack I must thank you for a wonderful  handy app that I just cannot do without on any of my devices since discovering it! I can't tell you how many posts I had painstakingly worked on  for a Facebook Group  or other post  trying to work back & forth from references to the post with only 1 ?clip copy? in memory  only to end up losing the post with a glitch before Clip Stack! I use it as a multi-tool  not only for keeping track of copied text  and edited versions of posts as I bring them together  but I?ll work directly in Clip Stack like a note pad  and organize references  notes  thoughts  even journal! The infinite # of clips  ability to back up & edit work  and floating icon are all part of what makes it fantastic.

Review 4: Truly a great app. I love that it support Android Wear and I can see previous items on my Watch. It works flawlessly and for being free  I have high respects for the dev. I installed Pushbullet on my laptop and Nexus and enabled Universal Copy and Paste. So when I copy something on my laptop  that text will appear on my Watch within a few seconds. Unrelated  I know  but perhaps something someone else may enjoy as well. Plus  the dev is awesome. I emailed him with a request which he replied within an hour or so. On top of that  he pushed an update out the following day with my request. Props to you!

Review 5: 5/5 with room for improvement! Awesome application  and honestly  this is one of those applications I would definitely prefer not to use Android without. Imo the one HUGE thing this application is missing imo RIGHT NOW in its CURRENT version  is the ability to sync its data with an online source of our choosing  ie google  onedrive  Dropbox  etc.The only other thing I would LOVE to see get added is the ability to have lists of specific contents per this app  for people like me that use this as a GTD app sorting of clip ideas is desired!

Review 6: I love the Floating Bubble to quickly access the copied texts (vs the common use of notification bars  which I don't like)  overall app looks clean  options in settings are all useful  notification on/off option is always welcomed  and no ads. Works on all apps  except the Floating Bubble doesn't show up while typing in Yahoo!Mail app (unless """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""always show"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" setting  which I don't use). That's the only (yet kinda biggie) bummer (so close to perfect) - otherwise it's great.""""

Review 7: Love it Can't live without it now  i use this thing constantly! thx so much to the dev  I'm going to donate as soon as possible! My only request woukd be if we could open the clip list in full screen like now  only fewer clips showing  so could read more of each  rather than having to click to get in &read to decide action. Oh! & maybe a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""move to bottom"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" ?so once pasted  yet still want to save  can drop it to end of list? Still  awesome app!!""""

Review 8: Terrific! This app is wonderful. I use copy and paste on all of my devices  all Android of course  and it was always a bit of a pain especially when I needed multiple items copied. This app should be standard on all Android devices  don't know what I'd do without it. Only change needed is syncing across multiple devices through our Google accounts or some sort of login system so what's saved on one device can be accessed on another. Otherwise perfect app.

Review 9: Really excellent A combination of both the 'clipper' and 'copy bubble '. A very good compitator for clipper that has few more features but lacking the floating window feaure of clip stack. Thanks a lot for the update with reading mode and the bug in editing tools fixed Please add features like snippets  font adjustment  and some dark theme other than black. Thank you very much for your valuable contribution. Thanks for fixing the bug 'sudden crash'.

Review 10: An excellent lightweight clipboard manager which uses minimal system resources. I especially like the floating bubble which means no swapping between apps to find and insert the clips  unlike the others I tried. I use the standard android keyboard to insert prepared clips (text expanding) from user dictionary so the two work together very well. The only feature I would really like to see added is a way to reorder the clips.",6225,Clip Stack is a free app that syncs data with an online source of our choosing.

Review 3: Needs work. Many tabs and panes don't work at all  no way to view full commit text  no way to accept merge requests  diffs are missing context making them hard to read  and markdown parsing is heavily flawed. The app is usable  sure  but these are some pretty big issues.

Review 4: Almost perfect! I can't open files in any of the several text/code editors I have installed though. The """"open with"""" dialog only shows a few options  and none of them can actually open a text file. This sadly makes it useless for quick fixes on the go.

Review 5: 2FA support App doesn't seem to support two-factor authentication. Once web login completed successfully and a verification code was entered the app stays in the web view instead of using the token to return to the app.

Review 2: Good  but achievements don't work Tracking progress is broken in this app  which takes some of the fun away learning with Khan Academy. I watched 3 videos  but 2 didn't get tracked at all against my progress  and 1 for only 11 seconds...

Review 3: Great but... My biggest complaint is the crashing for a back button. You have to click at the top to go back  rather than the back key  otherwise app crashes. Also  a search function would be nice but overall a very nice app.

Review 4: Cannot play downloads The interface is great and I can download videos to watch later but I cannot play those videos. Whenever I touch the Downloads option  the program crashes and just does not let me use it

Review 5: Using gone Galaxy S4 tablet. The App won't let me login to my account and when I click to any subject it shows nothing in the folders. I use the website but wish I could use the app.

I tend to get lost. - We could keep track of what we watched in-app - The app kept its position accross starts  also within videos. - When navigating up through topics  the app would go back to the same position in a screen. - We can properly navigate (tree style) the downloaded videos. Hard to determine what to delete now.

com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Negative,"Review 1: UPDATED...Still new to this  so will rate again  but... UPDATED: Having to uninstall  sadly  because it crashes every time I try to open messaging. Not uninstalling for that alone - that's kind of the last straw. PREVIOUS 3 stars  So far I like the idea and intent  but like some others have mentioned  push notifications would be great. Plus  I've had a couple use problems already in first day  including having the app choke while trying to post a picture and shutting down entirely when trying to access the message section. We'll see how things continue...

Review 2: Two gripes - font size & scheduled posts I like this app and I really do want to stick with it (it's a toss between this and slim social) but not having the option to change font size as I can in slimsocial may be the deal breaker. It is smoother than slimsocial on my phone but the default font size is simply too small on an average smart phone... Unless I'm missing an option somewhere  in which case I'd appreciate advice!?! Also  scheduled posting in managed community pages doesn't work - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""post"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button is non-responsive!""""

Review 3: Would be 5 star  but can't post pics. I've been using this app for a few years. It was fantastic!! That is  until I got a new phone with updated android. Now I can't post pics from my phone via tinfoil  but I can if I sign in on my phone browser. Definitely a tinfoil issue. I notice a couple of people already notified developers of this problem 9 months ago and it's still not fixed. Considering photos are just about all I post to keep in touch with overseas family  this is a big problem. Fix this issue  and I'll change my review to 5 stars.

Review 4: Help  developers! I really like the idea of this app  but not the reality. I'm unable to upload any photos through the app. When I click the add photo icon it just sits there like nothing happened. Also  I can't work around it by sharing the photo from my phone's menu to Tinfoil. It would also be helpful if I could submit these issues through the app instead of writing a review to you about my bugs. Lastly  and this would just be icing on the cake for me  but it would be nice if I could opt into push notifications somehow.

Review 5: This is exactly what I needed. The full Facebook experience with messages and none of the intrusive and unwanted application permissions which demand unfettered access to all of my phone. Is it possible to stop Facebook's mobile site from asking me to install the Messenger app each time I view messages? My answer to use the Messenger app is NO but it reminds me to install it before displaying the HTML mobile site messages. Wish Facebook wasn't so pushy. I may drop social media entirely if they continue to push like this.

Review 6: Needs more I had this awhile back  uninstalled it because it didn't offer the same things as Facebook. I can't go to my phone gallery and choose this to send pictures to. Why not? I can't shorten people's names to first names when tagging. I can't click multiple photos to upload onto my page  I have to go one by one. I can't send something to someone's timeline. This was the same issues as before! Can't you fix this stuff? What I love about it? It doesn't run constantly in the background  doesn't eat ram!

Review 7: Can't tag anyone Love the app but I can't tag individual people to share posts. Can you make this available or am I doing something wrong? Does anybody ever answer these questions? Tried Tinfoil again on 2/ 24  only used about 10 minutes before uninstalling. Would love to be able to use this app but when I used Google Voice to type my message I couldn't use the X to delete anything if I made a mistake. Still can't share posts on friends pages. Don't know what the middle share button is for it didn't work.

Review 8: Can no longer read message App closes when I try to get messages! WTF? Update: I noticed you never reply to questions in these comments. It seems this app is getting suckier by day. I used to love it and gave it 4 (not 5 because I can't post pics). But now  aside from the inability to post pics and the no more messages thing (which I suspect is FB's evil ploy  not yours) the app is lagging to the point it is impossible to use when trying to leave a comment in a discussion. Have to delete it now. Bummer 😣

Review 9: Crashes every time you try to access messages.. There is an easy work around for that issue.. when loading messages the #useragent variable must report as a desktop version not a mobile browser and the messaging works just fine. I was looking for an app to bypass facebooks malicious scripting  along with its ability to launch the google play app when clicking the message icon. This app seems allow many malicious scripts  While firefox mobile allows me to change the #useragent variable and load messages

Review 10: Useful Great app. Fb app was always a pain on android and when they started requesting permissions for even my SMSs  I decided that was it. Thought I wouldn't be able to survive without notifications on my phone as Tinfoil does not support this but got used to it and now I don't care. Recently the news feed has been playing up. Whenever I go back from a post it no longer takes me to where I was in the feed and also lots of posts get duplicated. This could be a fb issue rather than a Tinfoil issue...",5379,The app crashes every time I try to open messaging. Not uninstalling for that alone - that's kind of the last straw.

com.danvelazco.fbwrapper,Positive,"Review 1: I love this  does need a fix for android 5.0 / Nexus 5... I love this app and it does a great job. I recommend it. That said  There is a problem with latest Android and versions. I recently upgrade my nexus 5 to Android 5.0 (Lillipop) and I cannot enter space bar when trying to put comments in in this app (only in this app) so I can only comment using voice input. Would like to see that fixed soon. Behavior is this: I can type characters in comment field on a post  but when I hit space  no space is added. There is no way to type a space in the comment. This behavior is only on tinfoil app. No keyboard issues anywhere else in any other apps  etc.

Review 2: Makes Facebook a usable proposition The app is itself just a wrapper for the browser based Facebook but integrates everything nicely and works rather well considering. Dev if you could add the following that would be amazing. Longer pre-loaded news feed so you could choose to pre-load say 10 pages instead of waiting for the load at the bottom of each segment. A way to permanently select most recent  it defaults back to the lame top stories every so often. Also the news feed will occasionally lose it's permission if you interact on a post.

Review 3: Keep Facebook away from your data  and your battery! This application is an indispensable asset if you want the convenience of using Facebook as a social media platform and messaging service without the worry of Facebook mining your phones location and browsing data. It also combines both Facebook functions into one easy to use (albeit crude) application. No bells and whistles here  but that's a good thing. This app also has the added benefit of being %100 battery friendly  whereas Facebook wakelocks your phone 30-40 times an hour.

Review 4: My BlackBerry loves it! Awesome alternative since BB's native Facebook app is no more than a shortcut to the Facebook website now. Tried several alternative Facebook Apps on both BBW and PlayStore but they were either too laggy  unusable on my Passport or sucked way too much battery but this app is really well-made. First it's really simple to use  the interface is minimal at its best in comparison to some other apps and on top of all it is not a battery killer and it doesn't lag (even when using the inbuilt Messenger! Keep it up!

Review 5: Superior over faceballs I have been recommending this application for years to others and is always thank you for protecting our privacy as we use this application. Currently the only downside is that I am no longer able to send messages through this application but other than that it is absolutely amazing and does not invade and rape our privacy for using this application on our phones. It's lightweight  it does not run in the background like faceballs does and thankfully it does not invade our privacy on our phones.

Review 6: Best Facebook APP ever! This app is awesome! However  I have a suggestion  if you don't mind... I've noticed that when you tap the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Refresh"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option  it loads the News feed page. IMHO  it should refresh the page you're on. For instance  if you're on Most recent page  it should stay there and refresh that page. If you're on Notifications page  it should stay there and refresh that page. And so on. I hope you consider this suggestion. Anyway  great app. Congratulations! :)""""

Review 7: Keeps posting?! Really cant stand facebook  the app  and the majority of creatures that live in that weird world. But it seems updates need to be made by us to several profiles. We love this wrapper  but would like to see the ability to upload an image. Plus for some reason whatever we post (update  comment) gets posted 10 times..... unfortunately.... we only notice when one of us logs in from a desk/laptop. For just checking  without getting notified of every breath taken by your friends  it is fab!

Review 8: The BEST This is by far the best Facebook app I've tried  and I've tried them all. It's way faster than the official Facebook app  it functions more like the Facebook Web  but is better than using your browser on Android for Facebook. So far no glitches  works perfect for comments  video playback  ect. The best part is it doesn't hog resources and being able to use Facebook messenger within the app. Got rid of both the Facebook app and messenger app. Thank you Devs!

Review 9: Keep up the good work! Great app ! Excellent idea! I'm hoping y'all continue to grow and get away from all of the craziness that has consumed fb the last few years with the permissions and slick deals with the government. But as you grow there are a few big issues  loading pics and videos to messages and posts never seems to work for me and seens to be the biggest issue. Couple other kinks worked out and y'all while be right on the money. Good luck and keep it goin!

Review 10: Great app! One problem... This is an awesome app! Just as good as the Facebook app without all the ridiculous permissions. (And you can use messaging in it!!!) The only problem is that after sending a message  you get stuck in the messaging screen. The back button refreshes the page instead if backing out. You can navigate back to the feed  but pressing back will bring you to messaging again. The only way out is to close the app. Fix that and it's 5 stars!",5323,The app is itself just a wrapper for the browser based Facebook but integrates everything nicely and works rather well considering.

com.daviancorp.android.mh4udatabase,Negative,"Review 1: Nearly Perfect This is still a must have for mh4u players  but there are a few things I was disappointed with. Firstly  there are a few features that exist in the app (like armor sets) that don't work. If you can't add armor to an armor set it isn't actually a feature in the app. Also  the wish list is confusing  it would be nice to just have an inventory system where you specify what materials you have and what armor and weapons you have and then it tells you what you have the materials for  and what upgrades you can mak

The armor set builder also doesnt seem to work  adding an armour does nothing. Also  is it possible to add an extra section for hunting horn music  and highlight the damage value text when the monster is particularly weak to it in the damage chart?

I also encountered an error where the app shows the nargacuga cutwing is unobtainable.

Review 5: Feedback system is broken and doesn't work. No guide anywhere flat out tells you what element a monster is strong against or takes no damage from.

My only complaint is the lack of rotation since my g2 has the dead spot on the digitizer I can't search or look at great swords in the weapon tab or use the + wishlist buttons. A fix would be a godsend

Review 7: ... ... come on now..... Selet buttem in armor set make up didn't work. Im not able to do what i got the app for because of this. Other wise it has a lot of helpful information and everything else works well. (Add on) was trying to see if making. Charms worked  the + might be why armor maker dont work

Review 8: Rather good  but bugs Trying to look at the hunting horns causes the app to crash. Has a great amount of information  just a fue things missing. No clear list of what amo a bowgun can rapidfire/ siege fire  and creation materials for a good amount of the jewels are missing.

Review 9: Unsatisfactory on Xperia E1 running KitKat No information of items usage etc. and unable to search for armour pieces/sets on this phone model. Monster info could have also had health detail for ranks. Relic information would be nice as well.

Review 10: Armor set not working This app is literally a life saver  but I feel kinda meh when I see the cool armor set creator and it's not working. Plus it could use a general search bar. Will change to 5 stars if atleast armor set is fixed.",3617,The app is still a must have for mh4u players but there are a few things I was disappointed with. If you can't add armor to an armor set it isn't actually a feature in the app. The wish list is confusing. The app often crashes when inputting a talisman.
com.daviancorp.android.mh4udatabase,Positive,"Review 1: Great Resource for Hunters 90% of what you need to be an expert monster hunter is right at your fingertips with this app. I'd definitely recommend using this to take your hunting to the next level. A few additions/modifications are needed for this to be my only MH4U reference though: every category be searchable (just like the items are)  monster info should list it's elemental type and status immunities/weaknesses  and the quests should be listed in the correct categories instead of all stuffed info the 10 star quest list.

Review 2: Good  but Could Be Better Don't get me wrong  I love this app wholeheartedly. It's an amazing resource while I'm playing. However  a few key functions are missing. First  the armor set builder is unusable. Whenever an armor piece is selected  nothing happens  and the slot stays blank. Secondly  being able to search through the monsters  armor  weapons  and skills like you can with the items would be much more efficient and convenient. Once again  this app is amazing  but it's not the best it could be as of yet.

Review 3: Almost perfect! Needs some changes to the UI such as being able to sort items via price and other sorting options  it also needs to be easier to change the quantity of items you already have for items in your wishlist. The weapon trees are also hard to navigate  huge wall of weapons. Also in terms of skills  the description should be explained in greater detail and not just the game's description as those descriptions can be very vague. If these things were changed I would happily pay for the app. :)

Review 4: Vital for hunters I'm fairly new to the monster hunter series and this app has helped tremendously through my entire playthrough. I never go on a hunt before consulting this app for monster stats and I always know what I need to craft my weapons or armor. Plus it has the cleanest and friendliest interface of any app like this on the market. This app is an absolute necessity for rookie and veteran hunters alike and I look forward to the MHG database by DavianCorp.

Review 5: What's this? An app that lets me look up all sorts of MH4U info on the fly without having to look it up on my computer  including key quests  various weaknesses  and more? Yes please! Oh  it doesn't list any strategies or histories for the monsters you encounter  but considering the info already available on here  it can be over looked. If you're a fan of Monster Hunter  you're going to want  if not need  this handy app!

Review 6: Nice but need to update alot of unavailable descriptions . It happens too many times with me that I need to know from where to get a certain item while playing.. I open the app ..and find it ..but no informations about where to find or craft  for example ..divine armor sphere  ..nothing about it  only how many a player can carry !! ..but the effort is appreciated and it's beautiful app.

Review 7: Really useful. For the most part. I had an easier time going through to the Elder Hall and even prepared myself for each quest. I just wish that the Armour Builder function worked. I tried to put a piece of armour  but it was still blank. Please fix it. Some of the event equipment don't tell me what materials I need to make them. Please update app.

Review 8: It's amazing but... The app is great  it's really versatile and useful  but some features don't work  and some could use improvements  example  the armor set builder won't load in any armor when I select it. The weapon lists should be able to be sorted by elemental damage type  and the armor lists should be able to be sorted by skills and rarity

Review 9: Superb but still lacks something Davian corp. If ya could add more details on as to how to obtain certain items and also add descriptions of eac and every one of the items that would be amazing.. also hope ya can add how to upgrade the palico stuff like the food Armor and other stuff that can't be easily discovered in the game ya know? Thanks!

Review 10: Great! Perfect  but needs a list of weapon combos. I don't know how much work I am asking of you  But figured that all weapons of the same type (bow  great sword  etc.) have the same combo list. If this is a lot more work than I think it is  well... GREAT job on this!

com.dngames.mobilewebcam,Negative,"Review 1: This app would be amazing if it works properly. I tested it a lot in last two weeks and haven't got proper results.There are some problems or uncertaintes which should be solved: 1) motion trigger don't behave independent of regular snapshot interval. When I set motion trigger it still takes snapshots in regular intervals (refresh time)! The motion events inside the refresh time(with base of last motion event) are ignored! - I think that the refresh time for regular intervals and motion trigger parameters should be split and don't interact. Otherwise the behaviour is rather inpredictable. 2) motion triggers are not precise  the reaction is sometimes delayed or in interaction with other parameters  it is very uncertain. 3) trigger burst (at least for motion event) doesn't work at all. It always takes 1 picture. 4) when I set SD card directory which is not writable  application next time hangs or doesn't work properly  without any warning.The configuration in whole is not error safe  the input values are not checked for validity. Anyway I hope that this my investigation will help improve this app...as it wasn't updated for 1 and half year. And I'd pay for it if it gets solved.

Review 2: Worst of all worlds: It works enough to think maybe you can make it be useful but just ends up wasting hours of your time until you realize it's just broken. Lots of settings which is great.... but not explained so bad. Wants stary/stop time for day/night which is good... but it won't for example let you go past a certain time (aka now aka daytime). It lets you but if you go back it says a different time unless you stop at a certain point. Warnings to change settings but you think you did and nothing. Can't get it to stop taking pic every 10 seconds no matter how I fiddle with motion sensitivity. Could be useful - but I wish I had my afternoon back =( =( Shut down the entire app very clearly ... and then 2 min later - clicking every 10 seconds even though no evidence it's running. So had to uninstall it rather than search for help - but this is for the best.

Review 3: Horribly buggy Can't change image size from 320x200  upload to SFTP stops workung after some time ('No such file/directory'). Pretty sure the app also forgets settings sometines ... Horrible software... (On Google Nexus Droid) Update: I ended up saving the images to the phone which worked for a while. Sometimes the app didn't take pictures at the scheduled time though. Anyway  now the app started taking photos in 320x240 only. Can't take larger images... its ridicolous...

Review 4: Flaky piece of junk This doesn't work very well on my ancient HTC 4G (Sprint) phone which I'd like to use as a webcam -- it has many java.lang.NullPointerExceptions. I'm not an android developer  but the code is open source on code google com. If this worked  I'd pay several dollars for it -- a dedicated WiFi webcam with fewer features costs more than $30.

Review 5: New Problem Latest version  6 may 2014  takes one picture and then stop  using Samsung ace duos. I had used MobileWebCam for a year now until the 6th of may. Now it is not working  sadlly. May 14 release  the problem still exists. Please note  the ace duos has one rear camera  and I set up MobileWebCam to upload images to my dropbox.

Review 6: Full res not working Previous versions used to allow full resolution pictures to be uploaded  but regardless of me choosing the correct settings it refuses to do so. I've tried this on two different devices to Dropbox and FTP. Please fix!

Review 7: How do I get it to use the cellular network only? I see no way to use this as a webcam using the cellular network other than to use it with ksw server. Can you help me? TNX

Some users have also complained about the app's lack of features.
com.dngames.mobilewebcam,Positive,"Review 1: What an app! I knew what I wanted to achieve when I set out looking for IP cameras initially but thought we would have problems with firewalls in the office and then someone recommended this. Can't find anything that hasn't been covered by the author  everything I can think I'd want it to do has already been thought of - including Dropbox upload  auto-restart  motion detection  etc.! And the suggestion to use partially working phones is precisely what I had in mind (as we sell phones and have some with faulty earpieces or partly cracked glass). Best of all  it's free - would have paid for this functionality as it saves me buying an IP camera(s) and the time and grief of configuring it.

Review 2: Amazing piece of software Have used this on various old phones with varying degrees of success. Generally  the configuration on one phone will not work as well with a different one so a bit of testing is required with each model of phone used. Overall  the features available are incredible for a free app  would gladly pay for it. Users giving one star feedback and calling the app junk have to realise it is not designed for users who do not want to experiment with the settings. It's free! Give the guy a break.

Review 3: Awesome app. must have!! Can you please add a button to take pictures? Currently as soon as i touch the screen  even if the focus is not clear the picture is taken. What we want is the touch allows to focus correctly until image is clear and then the take picture button takes the correct clear image. If you can add this feature the rest app is 5 star!!!!

Review 4: Exelent for monitoring a place I use it to monitor a place where we take water from a river.Setup the cell to take a pic every 4 hours and email the pic to me.Have a cheap android fone for the job and I only need to charge it once a week (7days).Easy to set up.Low on data if sending low res pics dose not need 3G work on edge in South Africa

Review 5: Great app! I have been searching for an application to use my webcam and my android device for remote surveillance for some time and I found only crappy software  until I found this app... It has almost everything I was looking for  tons of configuration options  and it's totally free. Many thanks to the author!

com.doplgangr.secrecy,Negative,"Review 1: locked out of files & won't update database I am locked out of my files. I apply my password  and then am told to update. It never updates and then tells me I applied the wrong password. Backups fail too. Reported to helpdesk four days ago and no response. Uninstalled it to free the files to the root directory and moved them to my PC-they were corrupted and unopenable. Reinstalled it but couldn't move the files back to the phone. Now what? Hey  thanks for nothing!

Review 2: Nice but ... More bugs should be handled. Also  it should have the option to save decrypted content into a specified folder. By default the app saves the content on root folder which is really messy. Edit: more bugs. Some photos are not displayed. A workaround is to display another photo then go back to the other photo. Lastly  the app should have its own internal image viewer because the external ones leave thumbnails which defeats the whole purpose of this app.

Review 3: False security  watch out for retained thumbnails No fault of the app developer  but I found that Android had accumulated 3GB worth of reduced res thumbnails on my system under DCIM/.thumbnails. Not useful to lock down the app only to have the OS leave copies of the files laying around. I'll keep using the app  but I'll be manually purging that directory afterwards. On a side note  I recovered 3GB back from Android.

Review 4: time waster - bad bugs created first vault... start adding files... on 4th file Secrecy crashes... restart secrecy... enter the key to my vault  secrecy displays a list of my 4 files then crashes (again & again). can't access those files anymore ... what other feedback would I leave?? if a future release of secrecy is able to open that vault without dying I'll be happy to remove this feedback.

Review 5: Wtf?! I tried to move files from secrecy app to messenger and it kept telling me this app has stopped working... OK not such a big deal. Then I try to change my vault name and it tells me that vault name change has been aborted... Now all of my pictures are gone without a what  who  or why!!! I'm highly disappointed in this app... I've lost so many pictures!

Review 6: Doesn't work with sd card as said. Rough around the edges but it's functional. Problem is the reason I downloaded this one instead of any of the others is due to you saying storage was aloud on sd card. Used both methods to set storage in settings and only option given is internal. Moved app to sd card still same thing

Review 7: Abandoned beauty It's a shame this project appears to have been derailed. Even in its present form it is one of the best file lockers  combining the security of something like aVault with the photo browsing capabilities of the many others that offer poor or no encryption.

Review 8: It's working accept... The few issues I have noticed are that sometimes when viewing a .mp4 file it says incorrect data in the middle of the video and screen orientation is backwards aka if I want the picture in landscape I have to turn to portrait.

Review 9: Nice Per-file Encryption Encrypts each file and it lets you group a couple of them into its own folder structure. One big downside: save to SD card now does not work in Marshmallow - waiting for the developer to come back to fix this /hopefully/

com.doplgangr.secrecy,Positive,"Review 1: Actually works. I've been searching many hours for a file encryption system for Android. Most of them only password protect files in the app. The files are actually still wide open on the mobile device. Secrecy creates a vault into which you can import (move) them from the device. Even better you can export (copy) the files from Dropbox into a vault directly. This seems to be the easiest way to transfer files from computer to a secure location on a mobile device that I have found yet. If Dropbox was encrypted it would be perfect. For sensitive files it's probably better to USB them onto the mobile device instead.

Review 2: Just donated and trying out... I just donated and am trying out features  etc. Rating adjustment  up or down  pending more usage. So far looks promising and more intuitive compared to other similar apps I've used  but jury not yet reached verdict. Donated because I know very well the long hours a good developer invests in application... so I don't mind skipping a Coke or cup of coffee to support the dev's hard work! So  to all you haters & lazya_s complainers wanting all for nothing  do something to improve the world or SHUT UP!

Review 3: In having problems with pictures  after the password decrypts pics they can't be accessed. Only the thumbnails are seen  i can't click to open the pic because when I do I get a google photos error. Suck's  it's a great idea & app all in all  but photos need to be fixed. Nexus 5  android 5.1... It'd be awesome to add-on a root file browser  it does what it's meant to very good. A material ui would be a good addition  especially an action button. Thanks for your work & I will donate this week to keep you guys going.

Review 4: Good Well when i encypt some pics they still exist in gallery but they wont open i deleted the album manualy and when i dial the secret number i open the app and when closing i have to tap 3 or 4 times the back key to exit and when the app exit the dialler app try to call the secret code evry time sorry for bad english but i think u got me guys good work waiting for more future

Review 5: Impressive w/ enormous potential At first glance  the source code looks pretty legit. I see PBKDF2  CTR  CBC. I also see Exx  but that is probably there for debugging purposes only (right?). More points for having """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""personal initiative"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" recovery options. Special permissions requirements are reasonable. Call-to-launch is pretty neat.""""

Review 6: Great Functionality and Beautiful UI this is a really simply to use yet powerful little app that lets you encrypt+hide any file. That's it. No bells or whistles needed. My only suggestion would be (and keep in mind this may already be a feature that I haven't uncovered)  I want to be able to export the vault out to be opened on my computer or be sent via email.

Review 7: Needs more work but intended to serve its purposes. Very nice looking app and working fine after all but still needs more work. I'm know it's just an Alpha ver. so you can't accept that it will be working just fine as other apps so I'm just hoping that You will be pushing more and more updates and fixing problems. Nice job!

Review 8: Awesome Everything that it supports is great. Looks greats and functions great. Some cool features would be directories in vaults  multi file select  and being able to create save plain text files with a built in text editor. It would become the absolute best encryption app!

Review 9: One small thing... Something much needed is a file navigator within the app itself  and not having to rely on the stock one because half the time I can't find the files I want to encrypt. Let me know when you have done this as I will gladly reinstall the app as soon as this is done :D

Review 2: Broken  please fix! It used to work fine but recently stopped. Every single trip I look up says the next trains are coming between 60 and 70 minutes from the time I check when in actuality there are trains roughly every 15 minutes on most routes. I really just wanted to leave feedback for the developers and have no interest in rating the app but I didn't see a customer service contact or anything like that.

Review 3: Good for schedules  but timer doesn't work I've used this app every morning for the last few months  and it seems to always get me to my train on time. My only complaint is that the timer/alarm feature has never worked for me on my Galaxy S4 (4.2.2 and 4.3). I contacted the developer for help  but was unable to find a solution for the alarm not working.

Review 4: This app has gotten me to my train in the nick of time more than once  thanks to the accurate countdown to departure. My one issue is that the alarm doesn't seem to work on my Nexus 5X. I can set it  but it doesn't actually make any sound. That means I have to keep waking up my phone to check how much time I have left.

Review 5: Ok for diect but does not do connections well Excellent app if your train goes directly where you want. I think it maxs at one connection. Eg sfo airport to fremont  it does not see an opporunity to change at balboa and bay fair and save 20 -30minutes. The bart mobile web app gives it. Hence mixed

Review 8: N/A I've used this app for a couple of years and it has not giving me any arrival nor departure times in awhile... the app just does not work at all anymore...I found another app that works great  but would rather continue to use runner if possible.

Review 9: Good enough This app lacks one thing: an ability to set up notifications for delays. Every so often the system has a problem and it would be nice to be told about them rather than open the app to find out. Other than that it's great.

Potential support for Android Wear in the future would be great too. Would be happy to donate to support developer.

Review 2: Simple  Real-Time BART Info (and no ads!) - This app is excellent for quick access to real-time BART departures. Once you set your favorite routes  the next departure and price is shown for each route upon opening the app. Tap the route to reveal 2 more future departures. Tap one of the departures for more options. It will show if a transfer is needed  but no transfer station is indicated. Setting an alarm puts an entry in the notification shade  but no alarm actually sounds. Future schedules aren't available (suggest BART Usher if you need this).

Review 4: Hands down the best BART app Super stable  accurate  fast  and functional. Nearly perfect for commuters. I've been using it daily for well over a year. Thank you for creating it! My two suggestions to reach perfection: (1) have a special mode to sort/add departure favorites because it is easy to accidentally swipe one away  (2) allow for different font sizes on favorites list so more/less fit on the screen at once.

Review 5: Fantastic and easy to use BART commute app. This app  from a user experience standpoint  does what a lot of other transit apps I've tried fail to do. And that is give a clean and easily readable set of information without too much clutter. The design is a little outdated  but I would rather have an ugly design for my BART app than a pretty app that's a pain to use/ doesn't work. Great job!

Review 6: BART Runner is essential for any bart commuter. It is accurate and easy to use  optimized for being a useful tool in your life and nothing else. This app means I can literally run to catch trains when I know I can reach them  which sometimes translates to whether or not I get to see my newborn son before he is put to bed. If that isn't worth five stars I dont know what is.

Review 7: Perfect with a data plan  almost perfect without This app was great for me as a non-US traveller without a data plan. Small in size and easy to use  it got me where I needed to be and let me tell my friends when to expect me at the station because I was able to use the SFO wifi. An offline way to see the next train would have made this perfect for me.

Review 8: Best Quick Fix! But. . Best to to quickly find and manage times for trains. BUT  if you leave it on a live update page  which is accurate to about 3 seconds +/-  it will drain your battery but not the apps fault. Also  this is a small app for tracking and predicting trains. It does that perfectly. If you need more than you may need a different app.

Review 9: This is what I want in an informational app. No stupid graphics  no flash and trash. I entered my primary departure points and now when I head to BART I can open the app and right there it shows me  in real time  when the next train is arriving. The app does a couple things more  but this is what I wanted and this is what it does. It's perfect.

Review 10: Best Bart app I saw a TV screen at one of the Bart stations snowing where each train is realtime like a very slow video game.

Review 4: Impressive! This is pretty amazing in how it works  and translates images to text quite well! Video recording would be cool as well  which I wouldn't /figure/ would be too hard  but I don't know how this works

Review 5: Good idea Good idea to bring old style ASCII photo into mobile gen. For full colour mode   looks one char has more than 1 colour  is it possible to limit it to one chat one colour  which is full colour?

Review 6: Does a great job  thanks for moving the controls! Has live preview and has 5 Star potential but annoyingly every image gets saved to its own folder with no choice to change it  cluttering up my gallery.

Review 7: Almost perfect It's an awesome idea for an app. Really cool! Just wish the shutter button was on the right like in every single other camera app the shutter button is on the right lol.

Review 8: Nice camera app.much liking it. But however  images saved still upside down... Also when appearing it's totally shown on separate as without any seen evidence of known new folder.

Review 9: Great fun! Just a pity that you can't select white background (and generate the opposite characters) e.g. for in an e-mail or text document. That would be a nice toggle to add.

Review 5: Need to have four balls per game  especially the newest game. Music goes away sometimes  goes slow motion  also hard to play in bright light. Still a very good pinball game.

Review 6: Great  love it. But please -- please please -- go back to tap-paddles instead of swipe-paddles. Or make it an option or something. Please. Thanks  great job!

Review 7: Awesome game! At first the graphics look primitive but once you pop on some headphones and get playing  you'll never play another pinball game in your life!

Review 8: Great Game Excellent  with a range of well thought out tables  with clear  effective graphics. Sometimes simpler is simply better. Well done!

com.ds.avare,Negative,"Review 1: Database lacking (KLOR nowhere to be found). Dropping way points shows on map  but not on plan page  so unable to edit. Also unable to delete a way point on map view so couldn't even switch plan on the fly. I want this app to work  I hate apple and also hate foreflights inability to work with the Android market. Flight plan go has major issues as well but does better in my opinion. If I could combine these two I'd pay the same subscription fee I had with foreflight for years. This one is not user friendly unfortunately. FPG is more user friendly yet doesn't allow touching map to bring up terminal area info and plates for an airport you tapped  but this one does  yet editing and navigating the UI is awful. Frustrating. Make a product that competes with foreflight functionality and I will PAY.

Review 2: Phenomenal app I was unable to post in the forum. Is there a way to disable showing traffic but continue to show ads-b weather? I think there used to be but I can't find it now and there are times I only wish to see weather and do not want to see ads-b traffic on the map. Thanks  5 star life saving phenomenal app!

Review 4: Recent update made the UI look incredibly tacky with ill-fitting clunky bubble buttons.

com.ds.avare,Positive,"Review 1: Very good - and could be better; 4 3/4 stars. This does exactly what it's supposed to do - tells you where you are  where you're going  approximate altitude and all the other good stuff. I've used it in light aircraft and as a passenger on commercial jet flights and it works wonderfully. A couple of things could be better: *** Storage - Avare downloads and stores a lot of map data  and getting an Android phone to store that on the SD card rather than the phone's memory is a chore. I've done this on four devices and it's been manual every time. Create a directory on the SD card  then point Avare to store maps there. Then curse when it doesn't work the first time. With maps.me doing it at the push of a button  I'd wholeheartedly advocate this as an upgrade. Heck  I'd PAY for it - if it saved me an hour's fussing it'd be worth every penny. Just sayin' ****Flight planning. Not as intuitive as you might imagine - again it takes fussing. Since I most often use the app as a reference (""""""""""""""""where the heck am I"""""""""""""""") rather than as a guidance method  this isn't such a problem for me but I've heard complaints about it. Again GREAT app - could be greater still.""""

Review 2: Good and Bad. Kudos for work in progress. Good: motivates improvements by competitors' avgps apps  direct-to useful  inflight lookup of nav  wx  and apt info  excellent with FSX and Stratux adsb. Bad: UI clunky  flight planning unusable. Summary: Useful only for direct-to function and looking up info. Assembling such good data is an achievement  but needs a better framework for the interface. Still  it's better than paper charts or no charts  as it's free! APA excells in its connectivity apps  too. Recommend this over the also free FltPlanGo  which has UI/planning issues  too. For serious flying  rely on superb Foreflight  iFlyGps  or Garmin Pilot  for which you pay reasonable subscription fees. These pros - notably the first two - offer rock solid data and usable interfaces without issues.

Review 3: Works great on my Nexus 7 and 9 Update: just added ADS-B to my aircraft and works great with avare. I installed Navworx exp 6000. I use it in my homebuilt RV flying around the NW  and it works great. Just got back from a 2 week trip flying to the 4 corners of the US. Could not imagine having to buy and carry all the sectionals and the TACs for NYC  LAX  ORD and the other I flew around. Also has the Grand Canyon special flying routes chart. Only thing missing are the TAC VFR routes (back side of the TAC). It does have heli charts that are close. Avare made the trip better for me. Thanks. Getting better with each update. How many apps can you say that about.

Review 4: I've been using this for years; flying many thousands of miles with Avare. For a free aviation app this can not be beat! Very reliable and intuitive. If the industry wasn't bias towards foreflight  this would be my only go to flying app. I'm surprised there is no pay-ware extra feature for Avare. I know it goes against what they are for but it could keep Avare in the game for a long time to come. Thank you for your work Avare team  so to make my flying more safe! It just keeps getting better! Layered charts  synthetic vision  and probably more! Avare you did it again! Keep up the progress  I love bragging this app to foreflight only users!

Review 5: Cross USA With Avare Yes  I'm flying from California to New Jersey right now with Avare. It's awesome. Put it side by side with my airplanes GNS 430 and get virtually identical numbers. Love the ability to pinch zoom on sectionals!!!! Only one little bug  IMHO  when you enter a flight plan for a future leg it includes the distance from your location to that first waypoint. Probably something in the settings I missed. And sometimes I have to touch the segment in the plan to get it to turn pink on the map but these are small small things. For a free app I am Impressed!!! Many thanks to the developers.

com.duckduckgo.mobile.android,Negative,"Review 1: Limited images My Google search for why Google limits the number of pictures that show up in your query lead me to a page from duckduckgo. I assumed because my question on picture limits brought up that duck page  and they offer and alternative to Google's bubble  that I would see unlimited pictures of say...dogs. Wrong! The number of pictures that show up is no more and maybe less than Google. You come to a page where """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""next"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""more"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" doesn't appear. End of the line. Very disappointing!""""

Review 2: Clunky and polky I love Duckduckgo ( DDG ) application on my laptops and other devices. It's my 1st choice. Not so with the DDG search and stories app for android. Too cluttered and slow. Sorry DDG I miss the streamlined clear search engine I am accustomed to using. I gave it a fair shot. Even when I load the small window widget it is still much slower than Google app. Also the voice commands with my android are not seamless. I lose some of the hands free utility. IX QUICK is better but still about on par with DDG. So sad

Review 3: Incredibly Slow Maybe I don't know what I'm doing  but it seems to me that this is the slowest most unreliable search engine I have ever used. It is not uncommon for pages to take 30 or 40 seconds to load or to simply not load at all. I don't understand the reason. It doesn't seem to matter if I'm connected to wifi or my network  it's simply stuck on crawl as slow as possible mode. I like the concept but if it can't bring a page up in a remotely reasonable time what's the point. Anyone have sugestions??? Galaxy s7.

Review 4: No configuration  buggy 1. Can't disable safe search. Filters random things like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Kawasaki ZX-10R"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and you can't view any results. 2. Disabling JS in the settings breaks functionality on the search page itself – viewing image results should not require such a complex system. And  although slightly unrelated  ddg's homepage scroll-jacks on the quote/review area disabling touch based scrolling in a lame attempt to add custom-built swipe support instead of just using the standard.""""

Review 5: So much crashing... I have problems with loading some webpages and half the newsfeed articles. Crashes frequently and more or less had to resort to my other browser just to load a text and picture site. Other than that gripe  I adore DDG. I just wish you could search more images! It's difficult to find art references when image search is so limited. But the not tailored just for me results of DDG are what keep me coming back to the app. I actually get better results.

Review 6: The only one for me... Well  there's no denying it. We live in a world where privacy is gone. Plain and simple. There is the multi billion dollar companies out there that will sell your grandmas eBay passwords for a buck and we only make them richer for thinking that they are the only option out there. Yes of course I mean google. But I can rant about privacy until my phone breaks. The point is that this little duck is the David to googles Goliath.

Review 7: Superb Search Engine I use it with TOR. Wonderful for individual privacy. I have nothing to hide  but I cannot accept wholesale breach of individual freedom. Google has a lot to hide. Google is a shadow wing of US State Department. That's why NSA continues its mass surveilance operations with the support of mega corporations. This app lets us behave differently  individually  with our freedom in our own hands. SALUTE and SOLIDARITY.

Review 8: Love the concept  dislike battery drain I'm going to give it a few more days before I uninstall this  because I love the idea behind DuckDuckGo. However  for an app which shouldn't be doing much  ddg seems to drain an awful lot of battery. In terms of consumption  it's often top 5 and sometimes third behind Screen & Android system  even on days I don't use it. At best that's a waste  at worst it makes me suspicious!

Review 9: When using the microphone to ask questions of the mobile Android app the remainder of the screen disappears and the only remaining is the question that I asked with no way of clicking a button or other means to get my answer. Works fine if I type in my question . that method leaves an option for me to click and get the answer. The microphone issue is very frustrating and because of this I can only rate it two stars

Review 10: Great search engine I absolutely hated. that Everytime I got on Google. They were right there pushing their garbage down my throat(that I neither needed or wanted) like some used car salesmen pushing junk cars. Privacy was not my concern. Google has become more annoying than anything else. Been using DDG  & No complaints here  plus the privacy is a bonus.....  Google doesn't know when to stop . enough is enough.",4845,Duckduckgo is a free mobile search app for Android. The app has been criticized for being clunky and slow.

com.duckduckgo.mobile.android,Positive,"Review 1: Allways review! Its a great thing. Thanks everyone Been skeptical with everything thats been going on for awhile now. checking out DDG awhile back and was very interested. Been testing several and even looking for a customizeable one instead of making my own that switches themes would be nice.I bet who ever is behind DDG is LeGit!... If you feel like being more secure and standing up for the 4th? Amndt. You could always grab a Tor and Torfox along with DDG. I hear it gives the FBI rights to track you though..whocares. Also DDG is fastest and smoothest SE of the ones Ive tried so far. Simular to StartPage which I like the idea of old google devs making DDG has obviously made some improvements  Ive saved enough time so far like my unknown spurs fan down their callin scroogle for what it seems to be nowadays to write you guys my lovliest and longest review Evr!

Review 2: I love this app it is fun and easy and the name and the duck are cute I love this app I uninstalled the google app for this app and I don't regret it at all the number one problem with the google app is the permanent search bar at the top of your screen it is so annoying but the only way to get rid of it is to delete google so I traded google for DuckDuckGo and I love this app and my choice I recommend this app to everyone and I just love love love it its awesome so you know what to do hit the install button and continue on in a happy and a existing new way to search things so get this app now now GI get it what are you waiting for....I was not paid to do this I just think it is a awesome app and I love it

Review 3: Its search works well - precise  returns only what you ask for  which is great! Multiple (simultaneous) tabs functionality would add at least one more star. Downside: it allows or deposits cookies  and keeps a record of one's history (even though it has settings  and """"""""""""""""clear"""""""""""""""" options)! But I even found a search history item  not just remaining  but favorited - and don't think I did that. The beauty of this app  reputedly  is that its search results are directly related to user search terms (true)  and no tracking or traces left behind (not so sure of this  now). Going to have to keep a closer eye on the way it behaves for a while...""""

Review 4: Needs a few adjustments Overall the app is great! I've been searching for an alternative to Google  primarily because Google seems to have a bias in placing their own agenda into searches  whether it be tweaking definitions  or placing their own review system above yelp  tripadvisor  etc. ****One item that the developers should add  is to include data and statistics (such as graphs) that illustrate numerical values towards a question such as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""What is the population of ?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""**** Other then that  DDG is awesome!""""

Review 5: My favorite all around browser. Utilizes Google grade search algorithms  but without the tracking. It's also able to be used with Orbot  if you wanna get your proxy on. Icing on the cake is all of the interesting (well many are!) news stories to check out in the app  while you people do whatever it is you do with your time online. You get to pick only the available sources that you want. I usually have several browsers installed on my devices  but if I had to roll with only one  Duck Duck Go...you're it!!

Review 6: Censored In America To Be Controlled~Not This App! Rare App In Today's World! It's hard to find a place to do Research on Anything you want or need to find without Censorship because Someone paid to hide FACTS⚠⚠ ➡DuckDuckGo shows the truth! Just Type It🔗Look It Up🔗Do The Research🔗 Shockingly&Refreshingly Information shows🆙 This App believes in First Amendment  Freedom in America  They Don't Try To Control You!! ThankYou For A Amazing App! AMERICA

Review 7: This is the best Free Non-Tracking search application to use on the Web. Google  Bing  Yahoo  Dog pile  AOL etc track and record EVERYTHING YOU WERE EVER SEARCHING FOR. No thanks I will only use DUCKDUCKGO as they """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""understand what Privacy TRULY IS."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" They do not lie about Any of the Services that they provide """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""unlike the others"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" such as  Bing  Google  Yahoo  Dog pile  AOL etc. Excetera""""

Review 8: Error feed request Been using DDG FOR about 2 weeks now and it has been great. I am fortunate to receive 4G+ in my area and full signal. However these now both totally vanish and I get the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""error feed request """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" message. I then exit DDG and both signals return at full strength. Am I doing something wrong or is it a fault? As I would really like to continue using DDG as I found it is the best browser out there.""""

Review 9: It's a great app which works perfectly and doesn't skewer data like Google. For example when I searched for MRAs I saw both pro and anti MRA content  unlike Google  with only antiMRA content. My only gripe is this app doesn't have a multiple tabs feature  and incognito tab feature. Please add those soon. I'll change the rating to 5 then for sure! But overall great app definitely better than Google  and other sites which censor opinions.

Review 10: Great search engine. So so app The app is okay but often the text that I type doesn't show up in the box. Because I can't touch type on a screen I don't notice this until I hit the enter key. App often has significant latency and at times won't even show the results page. Uninstalled and will use the Frost Browser (both private AND tabbed) with the DDG engine from now on. ASUS ZenPad 8  Galaxy S6 Active. Both running Marshmallow.",5704,DuckDuckGo is a free search engine that does not track users. The search results are directly related to user search terms (true) and no tracking or traces left behind. The app is free and available on Google Play and the App Store.
com.dynamicg.homebuttonlauncher,Negative,"Review 1: Mislabeled If this actually was a home launcher then I might have use for it. This app is simply a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""swipe home button"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" replacer  otherwise known as the built in Google now gesture. In addition  Google now has been completely removed/reworked in marshmallow in which case this app is completely dependent upon and will have stopped working anyway. So again  this app has been grossly mislabeled. It's not home button launcher at all. Get your facts in order developer.""""

Review 2: I had a panic attack when Google Assistant infected my phone. Why does everyone assume I want to speak to my phone? And disabling Google Assistant just results in long-press-home bringing up a dialog stating Google Assistant is disabled. How useless! This app elegantly allowed me to go back to launching Google Now via long-press-home. Just set it as the default """"phone assistant app"""" and then set it to auto start if only one app is selected.

Review 3: Works perfectly It's fast  responsive and soooo good. The only thing I could complain about is that app organising in the tab is so bad. You have to press buttons to change their position and you can't drag 'n drop the apps to organize. Hope that would be added but even without that. 2 minutes is all it took and I'll never have do it again :D and ons other thing is that Icon packs don't seem to work unfortunately.

Review 4: I've seen great reviews so far  and saw someone used it to get rid of that terrible """"voice only"""" Google Assistant. Too bad Google Assistant cancelled it out even when it was """"off"""" (it'd just show me a box asking if I wanted to enable it again).

Review 5: great none of my moto gs that upgraded to lollipops' home buttons do their intended job any more because google is absolutely the worst company of all time so thanks for letting me launch apps without having to mash my back key

Review 6: Thank you for this! Google screwed me by making the """"assistant"""" my default home key long press. Stupid assistant only accepts voice input. I just want to type my search query! This app let me customize my home key long press.

Review 7: Problem in marshmallow The setting not to ask when there's just one shortcut doesn't work. It still brings up the window with the one shortcut I have. Used to work flawlessly before my updating to android marshmallow.

Review 8: Can't install Every time I try to install i just get the error code """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-2"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (I have tried restarting my phone but it doesn't work) can you help or is it just my phone.""""

Review 9: Doesn't do the one thing I wanted - automatically launch the 1 app i have selected (voice search). Others say it works for them. I get the Google Now app still

Review 10: I have a question. How do you get it to work from a long press in the home button. I can't seem to find out how to do this. Please answer quickly. Thanks",2908,The app is a replacer for the built in Google now gesture. Google has been completely removed/reworked in marshmallow in which case this app is completely dependent upon and will have stopped working anyway. It's not home button launcher at all.
com.dynamicg.homebuttonlauncher,Positive,"Review 1: I wanted this app for 1 reason - to be able to press and hold the HOME key to open Google's Voice Search directly and not the Google Now Launcher home (whatever that view with the cards is). I can already say """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""OK Google"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from any screen - but sometimes I'd rather just have the voice prompt directly (such as when I'm around other Android phones which are all listening for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""OK Google""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""!) Anyway  just wanted to say this app works perfectly for what I'm doing. I'm using a Galaxy S6 running 6.0.1 and like the instructions say you have to first set this app as your 'device assistant' which is buried in the settings. Also  I needed to change the settings in the app to auto-start the app as well (not show it in a list/menu).""""

Review 2: Favorite App Organizer Simply put... I have over 300 apps for learning  reading  browsing  bookmarking  and sharing all of the nerdy things that pique my interest. I have self diagnosed myself  in light of the aforementioned nerd confession  with an extreme case of Attention Deficit Disorder. Ever hit the home button to find where you saved an article on the desktop  and 30 minutes later  you are waste deep in the slums of Android  wondering WTF you were looking for? This app is the Adderall... If Google Play Store was a doctor. Makes hopping from one app or task to another  to share or save to another  etc. so effortless! I don't know how I ever accomplished anything of substance without it. Real talk. Try it!!!

Review 3: So useful and so necessary! First  five stars because the app does exactly what the developer states that it will do and it's not missing any options that I would want. On top of the app working flawlessly  it's definitely helped me resolve one of the many pain points of upgrading to lollipop. I actually held off the the upgrade for some time because of the xposed modules I rely on  but through this app and others I'm finding alternative solutions to get most of the same functionality I had on 4.4. Thanks for sharing your work!

Review 4: Love it  just not feature-packed This is the closest thing to what I've been searching for and works extremely well on my Samsung S5  but some shortcuts don't work and are instead added to the home screen of the primary default launcher. It would be perfect if I could choose where (vertically and horizontally) the window appeared on the screen. It would also be great to have the option of pages you can swipe left and right through. The aim with these features would be reachability on the screen.

Review 5: Hallelujah After seeing the Pixel phone launch event  I figured out how to use this app to use Google Now like the Pixel launches Google Assistant. Essentially  I can open voice search with a home button long press. It took a little tinkering  but the instructions are in the app description. It's pretty wonderful  just because I prefer pressing the button to saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""OK Google"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" every time. Should hold me over until Assistant comes to Android for real.""""

Review 6: Prefect for resigning long press home I spent hours searching for a way to reassign the long press on the home key action  and finally stumbled on this application. It works perfectly  simply long press on your home key and select home button launcher and then in its settings remove Google and add your desired app  and check the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""auto start mode if only one app selected"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the settings  and boom you're done! Thank you for the great app dev!""""

Review 7: Perfect for replacing double-tap action to open recent task For a long time I've been annoyed by accidentally going home when I want to open recent task on my Xperia S because of double tap action. Now it's no more because with this app and recent task app  I can open the recent task I want just by holding home button. Thank you for this awesome app  love the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""auto start"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature""""

Review 8: Works I hated the way long pressing the home button on my Galaxy devices opened Google without the keyboard. I had to then click on the search bar to launch the keyboard. By using this app to automatically launch the Google search activity shortcut  I've solved a problem that has irritated me for years!!! One long press action and the keyboard is instantly there for use. Good work 😎

Review 9: Does just what it claims to do for me on my S5 running Marshmallow. I was able to get rid of the unwanted Google Assistant which took over the long press of my Home Button in a recent update. This app allows you to replace it with another app. In my case I just wanted the Google Search home page like I previously had. Simple and very useful app. Thanks.

Review 10: THANK GAWD FOR THIS APP Google destroyed long home button press with its awful assistant app that only lets you use voice. All I wanted was a Google search home button like my Moto had! Well now I do :) works perfect and I can set it to auto open instead of selecting so it's almost exactly like my old moto's long press home button.",5111,"The app allows users to open Google Voice Search with a long press of the home key.

Really bad practice and out of order. You've completely effed up my contacts. Very rude ignoring users /customers - DO NOT INSTALL""""

Review 2: Good placeholder contact photo app  and now there's an expensive pro version :( This was a decent app that allowed me to create placeholder contact photos. Now you lock features with an expensive upgrade and include intrusive advertising in the free version. Unless this app gets fixed  I would not pay for more customization. It hasn't been updated in 3 months  the pictures are blurry and the contact system barely works with multiple accounts. Get Contact Photos instead. It's simple  sure  but the developers update it faster than this junk.

Review 3: Developer Assistance Please I recently uninstalled this application due to the fact that contact photos - even after uninstallation - that did not have the custom graphic had a green tint with a pixelated background. I consistently change my contact's photo  but it keeps reverting back to the green pixelated tint even after being saved. I want this to be fixed through a response back to this review as soon as possible telling me what to do so I don't have to continue with this frustration. Thanks.

Review 4: Well thanks dev for your response...but i actually liked the app for what it is and art is great way of showing your taste and style.But after what the app did to my contacts photos i didn't like it so i wanted to reverse them back to the state the were in.But ! hey there's no such option for that.It took me 2 and half hours to manually make them default photos dev.Hope you understand why my rating is so harsh!!!

Review 5: New update sucks This new algorithm changed the way names get images now and it blows. Now all A's look the essentially same  and it's the case with all letters. The letters are different colors but the difference between so.eone names """"""""""""""""Adam"""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""AJ"""""""""""""""" in my contacts is almost impossible to tell. Defeats the purpose of having this.""""

Review 6: Used to be good...still a good concept. Just had a look back through my contacts  the images created by this app used to look a lot better. There were colourful shapes overlapping and pixel patterns. Go back to that. Every picture this makes now is REALLY GOD-AWFUL UGLY. I'm going searching for an alternative  will update this review if I find a good one.

Review 7: Fixes a problem  then creates another one I think the app is well intended. But you end up with a bunch of pixelated contacts.

Review 9: Inappropriate ad placement/usage Using ads for monetization purposes is fine  but full-screen interstitial ads that play sound are obtrusive. Furthermore  some of the ads don't make it clear how to dismiss them initially and will often result in inadvertent clicks. Otherwise  it's a great application.

Review 10: The only downside is the resolution of the pictures.

I have the wicked OnePlus 2 and when I am in the Google Messenger app the small circles are very fuzzy around the letters so I was wondering if they can be changed in an update? The normal picture when I open the contacts is absolutely crispy but otherwise is a bit dodgy. Really wanna give this 5 stars! fix the resolution and I'll be telling all my mates about this sick app!! Cheers.

Review 2: Not bad at all Works just fine for me.. I took it for what it is: an app that fills in empty pic slots for my contacts. Some of these guys on here must think their pro photographers or something with these write-ups...what they really need is to get laid.. Go out in the REAL WORLD & stop sitting around the computer 💻 writing up useless app summaries!!!!!!!!! Thanks to the Dev's for your hard work!!!

Review 3: Nice feature  but needs a lot of improvements Please include the ability to update images of select contacts  and a backup option to save the earlier user image automatically  and revert to it in case. Options to change the font weight would also be welcomed.

com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Negative,"Review 1: Don't download unless you want to lose info on what books you own and who has your books. Maybe you want to end up getting your books stolen. Not me. DANGEROUS WASTE OF TIME! DELETE! I loved this application and entered much of my library into it. Would have recommended it to anyone - glad I didn't though. I backed up my database to an SD card like it says to.When I got a new phone and transferred the settings over  the database I'd spent so long creating was gone. I tried to restore from the SD card. The app  which encouraged me to back up this way  was the only app on my phone that didn't recognize external SD card. So  database lost as well as records of who has borrowed my books.

Review 2: I like the concept but it isn't working with audiobooks. Downloaded today. It gave me an error (I have fedex tracking app that it was clashing with). Uninstalled fedex then had to install barcode reader  the first one didn't work so I removed that one and downloaded the other one. Tried scanning the barcode on audiobooks but it doesn't work. Tried it on an old textbook and it worked fine. I was able to type in the isbn and needed a wifi connection for it to find the book I was planning on using this to keep track of the audiobooks that I listen to but will be looking at other options.

Review 3: I loved the app until I got a new phone and none of the data was there and the other phone had been wiped clean so no more books. I have been compiling this app for almost three years. Everything lost. No mentions anywhere to export the list often or back it up. So sick at the lost work that I am fighting the urge to throw-up. Tech advice was to only use apps that require a login and to check out their website to make see how """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""backup's"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" are performed. Are they my responsibility or the app's responsibility.""""

Review 4: Useless and limited scan options Downloaded recommended Zxing scan app in order to scan titles to this app. Zxing doesn't work. Tried a different scan app  now this app tells me it only works with Zxing or pic2shop scan apps  and not the scan app I was trying to use (which  sadly  was actually working for me - recommended Zxing and pic2shop scan apps don't). This app needs to be more flexible with scan apps thay can be used with it. Reading other reviews  this seems to be a common issue the developer has not addressed.

Review 5: All is lost I loved this app! I had selected the back up button and backed up all 1000k of the books I had spent hours entering  this app is a necessity for me so that I do not accidentally purchase duplicate books. However.... My phone got smashed and now I have nothing  I even tried dragging and dropping related files I could find on my old phone into my new one but nothing worked. Any way to access my extensive library? If I can somehow recover my library my rating will certainly change to a 5!!!! =)

Review 6: Useless app If you intend to use your existing ebooks look elsewhere  for this limping app allows only internal memory . An indication that most 2260 approvals has no more than 20 book library  the rest   the 164 disaprovals found it impossible to direct the app to the external SD storage just like I did trying to load my 7000 ebook from my 64Gb external SD storage.. no where in the setup to find external memory mentioned. Lets see if the author have a logical answer. ( my device is the Samsung Tab S2)

Review 7: Froze while cancelling and i lost 3 hours of cataloging. It was going to well prior so that I considered it 5 stars. Now it is a 1 star.... Update: unfroze after 37 minutes of cancelling. My wife's froze while searching for over 45 minutes. I now archive after a couple of books. I appreciate the work put into this app but if it keeps freezing I can't use it. I am raising it to 2 stars. If it stops freezing then I will raise it again.

Review 8: Loved app til I got new phone. On my old phone I kept backing up my books. When I got a new phone and tried to import them the app says they're not there but when I look at my sd card they are. Plus rotating images worked until I ask not to show me the pop up any more. Now it won't rotate. I have over 1600 books and now because of the import issue I have scan them all over again. It's a pain to have to redo everything from scratch.

Review 9: I've used this app for awhile and I have a large number of books. Mostly its fine  but they do not respond to emails when there is an issue. Even after following directions exactly when switching phones  my books were there but the covers are missing. I have nearly 1000 books so I'm not about to scan them again. If they were even a tiny bit responsive  they'd get a 5 star review  but I've emailed 3 times with NO RESPONSE.

Review 10: Great to categorize books but doesn't seem to scan children's books This is a great app to categorize all my kids books  we literally have about a thousand classic books and I wanted to keep track of which ones we have.

com.eleybourn.bookcatalogue,Positive,"Review 1: Though infrequently updated - and going to check his website and toss him a few dollars if he accepts. For FREE(!) this app is beyond all expectations. I have over 1300 books in it. the ability to sync to good reads (at least receive from  believe send to is broken)  cross reference with library things  keep track of loans to people  and backup reminders (and the backups work!) are an amazing value. Let me explain the basic process. 1.) Download this app and good reads app 2.) link to goodreads and librarythings 3.) Open good reads and use their UPC scanner to scan in everything you own indiscriminately. Try to organize on teh good reads side if you feel inclined. 4.) Sync from good reads (one way  if send is still broken) - all books  their covers  synopsis  page count - all data is now in book catalogue. You can search by auther  borrowed  and more. Saves me from re-buying books - since 1300 is a little hard to keep track of. Furthermore  unlike the good reads app - this works offline. I can also give a copy to friends if they want to borrow they have a copy of my database. My favorite android app - yes  synergy between others  but the developer did it!

Review 2: I have been using Book Catalogue for a long time and I am very impressed. I have tried several Apps for cataloging my books and this App is the only one that has everything I need and much much more. It makes it very easy to keep track of the dates I begin and finish a book  I love the cover photos and also being able to sync with Goodreads. I really like that I am able to search for books with the Author Name and the Name of the book  or a few other options for adding books. There are many options to customize fields so you can see all information desired about a Book  Author  ISBN  Series  Publisher  Reading Dates  Ratings  Notes and more. I also love that I am able to look up a book by the ASIN. I am almost always able to find each book I search for. Keeping track of my Library has never been easier. There is the Name of the Book  It has the Author Name  ISBN  Page count  type of Book(paperback  Hardcover  Audiobook  etc...)Bookshelves  Notes  Reading Dates  Location of the Book  the Description and more. I am very happy to have found such a useful App  I use this App Several times a Day.

Review 3: Great app! I have been using this app for a while and have saved over 700 books with it. I'm an avid reader  and I use Kindle Unlimited to borrow books to read. If you buy a book from Amazon you can later see if you've read it  but if you borrow one with the Unlimited program and then return it there is no way too see if you've previously borrowed or read a book. It was always a problem remembering which books I had already read. With this app I can keep track of the books I have previously borrowed. I can keep a personal review of each book. It is easy to put the books info into the app by using the ISBN or ASIN number  or you can do an Internet search for the book or enter it manually. You can expand or collapse the list of books making the list quicker to navigate. The app occasionally reminds me to do a back up so I don't lose all that info  and the backups are easy to do. I use this app everyday  and would highly recommend it. It not only lists which books I have previously read  but I can look to see whether I liked the book or the author. Wonderful tool.

Review 4: Brilliant - the best there is!! I've tried several book cataloguing apps to track books I've read and this is the best I've ever found! Easy to use with excellent help tips for first users. Far too many features and functions to list them all  but adding  sorting  customisation are extensive  well designed and easy to use. Love the fact I won't lose data painstakingly entered  as I can sync with Goodreads  export to csv  and back up to SD card. Only issues I've faced so far are related to Goodreads  not this app! :) Anyone who's a keen reader or who has a book collection they want to catalogue will love Book Catalogue. And I'm sure you'll also think  like I do  that it's well worth making a donation to support the developers!! They can't earn anything through Google Play for their wonderful work  because they're Australian.

Review 5: Lot of features  little left to desire It's a nice feature that you can order your books according to bookshelves  this will help you find your physical books. There's an option to export the data of your books  in case you need all your information on your computer. One thing I would mention  once you put a book to one bookshelf  I don't think that there is an easy way of moving it to an other bookshelf in the app like scanning it on another bookshelf. It supports a few scanner apps  from which google googles is the best  but I'd be happier if i-nigma was supported as it's very fast  or if I could add books by importing the ISBNs. Also it's a shame only barcodes can be scanned and not ISBN numbers. (some books don't have a bar code).

Review 6: I'm a teacher and desperately needed a comprehensive cataloging app to keep track of my expansive book collection. This is the best one I've used so far. I can categorize my library to my heart's content! I would like to see an option to duplicate books (without having to reenter information) or add a quantity note for multiple copies of books. Adding a multi-select long press to select multiple books to bulk edit a certain data section would also be really great! I would also like a cleaner way to view books in a certain series  like hyperlinking the series to see all books from my library in that series. These suggestions would make this app the perfect cataloging app for me!

Review 7: The best book collection app I have found Excellent  well thought out app with no nasty catches  it does it all without restrictions - add by by scanning barcodes  or enter ISBN. It fills in the rest  even allows you to add pictures taken with your camera. You can sort the views and export to csv files send by email  google drive or other options. Sync to goodreads and Library Thing too. Note that it found and used the QR DRoid Private scanner already installed without a glitch (other book managers force you to install another scanner with intrusive demands like accessing your contacts and personal data!) Perfect in every way  a big thank you to the developers

Review 8: Excellent App for Nexus 7 Eventually found this app after trying and rejecting many other catalogue apps. Functionality was exactly what I needed. Interface was reasonably intuitive (to an android/touch screen newbie!). A key requirement was to be able to export/import book data. This was achievable by means of a file management application (to get the file back onto the Nexus  which has no micro SD card) and an appropriately formatted CSV file. Note that Excel cannot format the file correctly  but LibreCalc can. Only thing I couldn't fathom out was how to get the same book onto multiple shelves. Other than that I'm very satisfied.

Review 9: I absolutely love this. I add books by using the Enter ISBN option because it's really quick. I'm getting ready to move  so I captured all my books here  emailed myself a .csv copy (Admin > Export to CSV file)  and opening it up in Excel. From here I can make a list of books to sell  import it into a book-selling site  and so on. Really useful! (Tip: If you enter an ISBN and it says it's not valid  it could be an old 10-digit ISBN. Look for an ISBN that starts with 978 or 0-978. Can't find it? Google ISBN calculator and find one that will convert the number for you or just use Book Catalogue's Search Internet option.)

Review 10: Best Book Catalog App Around!! I love this app - great when I'm in the bookstore and can't remember if a book I""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""m looking at is one I own or one I borrowed from the library!! I also love the level of customization  including the way you sort books  the easy way to add more shelves and then filter by shelf. I wish my DVD catalog app was this good!! My only complaint is - there's no server backup so there's no synchronization between phone and tablet  which is essentially why I got rid of it off my tablet. Are there any plans to introduce someone sort of synchronization option in the future??""""",8288,Book Catalogue is a free app that syncs with goodreads and librarythings. Users can search for books with the Author Name and the Name of the book or a few other options for adding books. The app also allows users to write a personal review of each book.

Review 2: Complete waste of money Won't change start up permission on either system or user apps on Android 5.0 (Sony m4 aqua). Autostarts has been given root access in latest version of SuperSU. Other apps that require root (eg titanium backup) work fine. I emailed developer but received no reply. I also tried it on my Acer tablet that runs Android 5.1 and guess what? It didn't work on that either

Review 3: Overall  great app to have and use. lately i'm having a little problem. I'm using an HTC One M9 and its rooted but when I got to disable something. the app isn't letting me. I guess it is telling me that I don't have root when I know I do. has anyone experienced this lately?

Review 7: LG G4. I have used this app in the past with other phones but it seems to be broken with my G4 running Android 5.1. I grant it SU permission but it spits back a toast about not having SU permissions when I try to disable an app. Please fix.

Review 8: Doesn't work! Brand-new VS986 (LG G4) with root access running 5.1. Autostarts has been given root permissions but fails to see root and then does not work at all. I've reached out to the dev  but as it stands this is 100% useless.

com.elsdoerfer.android.autostarts,Positive,"Review 1: Nice  seems useful Two UI issues for me. First  there doesn't seem to be any way to sort events alphabetically.

This means it's hard to hit the 'i' and very easy to hit the scroll bar by mistake  and jump to somewhere completely different in the long list!

Keep the information/help message that appears after clicking """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""i""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  for a longer duration.

Review 4: Best app for rooted phones Every rooted android needs this app. Lets you disable apps from starting up & running in background. works w/ system apps. It's like msconfig from Windows for android

It will change colors and allow you to pull down the tray without interfering. But I commend this developer for thinking about this long ago!

Review 3: downloaded just to give a five star rating to offset the people who don't understand what this app is for. this app is for SCREENSHOTS. the point is for developers to have a basic default status bar for clean screenshots to put on the play store for advertising. this app does its job perfectly.

Review 3: ESSENTIAL Tool - INSTALL THIS NOW AND READ ON CURRENT MALWARE Having been very heavily into modifying Android devices for about 8 years.

Review 6: Excellent and very flexible app Great help on the site. I would like to ask the developer to add the the following about the Process tab to online Help: 1) to switch from Advanced mode to Basic  you need to go to any other tab and back  or press Back 2) to kill a process in Advanced mode you need to press on the garbage can icon - it will turn into X icon  then select the processes by clicking on them  then press on the X icon 3) to sort the processes - switch to Advanced mode - press on the histogram icon - select the desired criterion

Thank you.",2396,The app works perfectly well and I have yet to com across any bugs. If there were more device frames available (or the ability to add your own) then it'd be an easy 5 stars. The only problem is the limited devices to choose from  personally I think it is far too little.
com.farmerbb.taskbar,Negative,"Review 1: Good idea but very shortcoming. Uninstalld Not what I thought. I've have both an s7 edge and note 5 and I thought this would be like the edge apps on s7 edge so I put it on the note 5. But all I see is a long list  same as the app drawer icon shows. And never has there been a tab or window for recent apps  not that I need it on this phone as there is a button at the bottom for that. but the fact I can't pick which apps I want to show up in the list when touch the icon is very disappointing. Not user friendly enuf. 2nd app drawer is unnecessary.

Review 2: Needs to be deactivated constantly when other apps are requesting permissions because of screen overlay. Is it possible to make the little arrow slimmer? No matter which corners or orientation I place the arrow  it seems to hinder me from tapping the button below it. Perhaps to have the option for a thin translucent black strip in just a few pixels?

Review 3: Best Just to let you know on Nexus 9 7.0 Nougat which was made with 5.0 can't handle Parallel Windows for Nougat and it might be a virus so I WILL NOT use the multi of one app feature but don't remove it because someone else might like the feature without having a KEEPS STOPPING virus. It's a virus if you ask me about Parallel Windows for Nougat!

Review 4: Great app but not working It's a great idea and implementation but when I clear the ram it's getting closed. I'm on miui 8 and I added this to auto start  gave permission for user access but still it's not working. Please fix it.

Review 5: I downloaded this app and part of my navigation bar disappeared! I uninstalled and still I'm missing the home button and the recent a button. Not sure if the app cause this  but it seems so! I'm on a NVIDIA Shield K1 running 7.0

Review 6: Can be better I like this app. But not convinced enough I should move to pro. Why? I have to keep selecting it again and again and when I switch off my phone  it doesn't come on automatically even after enabling auto start.

Review 7: unstable at lenovo vibe k5 plus.. good app but it is unstable at my phone... when this app is installed at my phone... battery percent.. doesn't increase at charge. and doesn't decrease when plugged is remove. bugs..

Review 2: Top notch  exactly what the Pixel C was missing I just got this app about a week ago or so and boy have I been missing out. I had been running Remix OS for more of a desktop experience on my Pixel C but there are quite a few things I did not enjoy about it. Taskbar is much more user friendly to get up and running than Remix OS  and it provides the user with a similar experience without as much of a hassle. The only thing I would like to see at some point is the addition of widgets on the Taskbar home screen  start menu folders  as well as a little bit more refinement with mouse input  however the latter might need tweaking on the software level. Great app  great job guys.

Review 3: It does enable the feature  and the window flows effortlessly  but resizing is very difficult. Wish there was a dedicated resizing  from fullscreen  to floating. It is another launcher per-se. If you don't have adb installed on a PC  or can't fathom how to use the native way to have floating windows  this works. Would have been nice to have just the floating part  without the launcher. I did the adb way eventually  should make this  without the launcher part  android has too many ways to do launcher. The native way is more smooth in the resizing aspect  but your app floats windows just fine.

Review 4: Amazing application! Has greatly improved productivity on my Pixel-C. Two suggestions to implement if possible: 1. Ability to show only running apps (i.e. those seen once you hit the overview/app switcher softkey) and not all recent apps (when I close an app usually done with it  so not needed in the taskbar even if I had it open recently) 2. Ability to change icons in task bar manually instead of applying a whole icon pack (I am very picky about my icons and change them all individually). Keep up the great work  this app is indispensable to tablet users!

Review 5: Good job... There's much more to do. There is an app on the Play Store that the developers should download without delay. It is called Cover Lock Screen  and it was not only ahead of its time  it also has the most innovative activation feature ever developed. You see  Cover was more than a lock screen. It was a quick app switcher  much like this app. But Cover's activation gesture is what made it the best. It never got in the way  no matter what  and here's why: Cover overrides the right side of the notification shade. Please add swiping down.

Review 6: This thing is FANTASTIC for tablets  even without freeform window mode. Just the fact that there's a taskbar at the bottom makes multitasking a lot faster than having to constantly go into recent apps or exit to the homescreen to switch apps. One thing that would make it perfect (unless I missed it in the settings and you can already do it) would be to block off that portion of the screen  effectively using it as a navigation bar with apps. Being able to close it with the keyboard is almost as good though  but that would make it perfect.

Review 7: It's absolutely great Currently using this  on my pixel c  and it's great when using a mouse.(currently writing this review with taskbar) However  is it possible to implement hotkeys to resize windows easier(Ex. Win + Left : move window to left side of screen) and desktop icons for the launcher. Keep up the great work! Maybe I even could use this in conjunction with parallel windows. EDIT to DEV: It be fine if you have to restart them for the hotkeys. Also is it possible to have taskbar take up the whole screen space left to right

Review 8: This is an amazing app and lays the groundwork for a totally new experience! It is ideal on tablets in freeform mode. I do have a couple of questions/suggestions: 1. Google Now voice integration? Saying """"Ok google"""" doesn't seem to work. Any chance of this being addressed? I don't mind if the """"Ok google"""" cards launch windowed. 2. Any way to have more than one """"widget"""" screen? 3. Are window decorations and border controlled by this app or by Android? Right now the decorations  esp resizing windows is a bit touch and go.

Review 9: Nice would be perfect but I love this using it on my GS7. Love that it's discreet seeing my home screen has nothing on it but a zooper widget time/month widget. The reason not a full 5 stars would have love to have seen a more transparent background in the menu option to select the which apps to remain visible  just like the most recent apps but I don't use that in particular so it's shut off. Nice hope more improvements come. Needs transparent theme & options to remove app names

Review 10: OMG This is such a great concept! Please  keep updating and improving the app and this will be huge! It would be great to have the ability to change the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""app drawer"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" icon or make it change to a black one when selecting """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""dark theme"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". As well as a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""swipe down"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" gesture to see notifications and folders for the app list/drawer...

Review 2: Useful It's a very useful life counter. Can be uses for multiple different games. The only thing I think they should fix is to add the line under the 6 and the 9. So you can tell the difference between the two when the flip counter option is on.

Review 3: This is the best life counter from the 10 I've tried so far. Very beautiful and simple. The only thing that is missing is the option for more than two players.

com.frostwire.android,Negative,"Review 1: I've been following FrostWire since it was known as limewire yes it has its kinks but id like to see ppl make there own free music site and tell me if its easy nothing is perfect and ppl get to frustrated cuz they dont get what they want when they want it well to bad thats life cuz i get what i want from it any and all song videos and so on its trial in error some times and the emblem is not an eye it is a barbed wire duhh no wonder these ppl cant get what they want cuz they cant tell the differance between an eye ball and a barbed wire like wow makes me sad to be a part of human race some times and as far as it running all the time if u use personal limited data and dont want it to run out turn data off the downloaded music still plays without data or get wifi in your home if not sounds like a personal problem thats my thought hope many idgets sees this all tho it wont do them any good if they cant figure frostwire out im surprised they can wipe their own a*s. thanks love u frostwire

Review 2: Initially it worked well. Could find most of what I looked for  although i had to weed through a zillion covers first. Unfortunately  I have to go through a thousand hoops to close the app. And now  there is nothing but covers. And  if I delete the app  I lose the music. So  yeah  it's good at first  but idk if it's really worth the hassle and memory it requires Response - whenever I click exit I MUST watch the ads that pop up or the app will not close. And  that is ONLY after I've done this at least 3X. Sometimes as many as 7X. So  when I am trying to conserve battery it is EXTREMELY irritating. I don't use an SD card. I have lots of storage on my phone  no need for it. Other apps download the music to my phone. This one doesn't even let me move the music over to my mp3 player. It's weird. And annoying. I'll look for an update  but idk if I want to open the app again. It takes sooooooooo long to shut it down

Review 3: This app does not work I want to kill it it makes me so mad I want to throw my phone it is not a good app to use if you want to download music if you wanted to music I'd suggest download downloading any other because it's a piece of crap so if you want to download an app do not download this one I hate it you will hit it and everyone else when heated it makes you want to scream your head off and make sure I thought your phone so if you don't want to call your phone and cracked It or Break It I suggest not using this app is a piece of s*** Nick so you should go down there never a and guess what I'm sure anyone have to say this app is a piece of crap so because unless I say it because this is a bunch of my gosh so do not download it you can download it for a thought your phone but whatever goodbye I hate it so ok

Review 4: First of all there are a lot of mislabeled songs like they would be called something but when you download it  it turns out to be completely different or just a bunch of musical instruments and every 10 mins there would be an add it could be really long or short but overall it was alright but could you please remove some of the mislabeled songs or at least rename them because that is the most annoying thing about the app and I uninstalled it but it said I didn't and kept downloading random songs on its own so when I tried to install it again to sort the problem out it wouldn't let me re download it and now my music is flooded with random songs and stuff plz fix cuz its taking up all my data space and all that

Review 5: Always been my to go to music downloader Only issue I have had with FrostWire is the fact that it can be misleading when purchasing the ad free version $5.95 for a year no in reality it's $5.95 for a year with the price of payment of that per month maybe fine print that a little better cause when I was receiving ads after first month payment I'm wondering wtf Other than that another thing is you guys could used a volume booster of sorts on your equalizer which doesn't really work well Also maybe when ppl download music you guys can find the cover art for the album's or tracks Food for thought I'm a Loyal Fan been team FrostWire for Years  just a couple of things to still iron out

Review 6: Great when it works  but unfortunately that isn't very often. Most music I like isn't available on the app  and even if I did find an album  most times it wouldn't download properly anyway. Now  that would be okay with me  but instead of just deleting the broken files from my phone  it instead keeps them and makes them impossible to delete from my storage. I've got so many broken songs and files cluttering up my phone now  and I have no way to delete them because they're 'stuck' on my phone. Very  very infuriating  and it really makes my music selection untidy. Will not be using your app again.

What it want me to do now is to download the bullshit plus version with all of the features of the frostwire ( which supposed to be this app on the play store) but when I install it my antivirus warn me of the app wants to access my contact information and google play billing services. Seriously what are you gonna do witb that information? Oh I know leak my personal information in the internet and make money out of it.

com.frostwire.android,Positive,"Review 1: This app is incredible!!! Ever since Limewire had problems in 2009-2010 with lawsuits and all this app emerged 2 years ago believe someone told me in 2014-2015. It has been so amazing and I am so glad that once again we have access to a free Downloader that is legal download and is protected to be going strong on the market. Thank you to the developers for bringing this!!! It seems like everyone was starting to lose hope after Limewire was found out to be terrible after hearing about their lawsuits for whatever reasons. My hope is that Frostwire continues for years to come!! I have been able to find my favorite artists most of them on that site. I am very well pleased!!! Job well done guys 5 out of 5!!!

Review 2: Still an amazing app. I use a HTC M9 First and foremost this app is wonderful. What it's able to do is on point. And the updates have for the most part have been a success. The only issue I have are two things. When downloading a large file 2g or up it will hiccup and go to pause even though there is a large seed. Second  when downloading large torrents sometimes  but now more frequent  it has been erasing my download list showing nothing downloading  I know it's there because if my file app. Again I would still recommend this app. 10/10

Review 3: Can't always find the music I want but it is free For free songs it's great  i only wish there were more songs. Lately I've had a hard time finding alot of the songs I'm searching for  it will display other songs from the artist but not the one I'm searching for. It would also be nice if you could search by the name of the song & not just the artist name bc i don't always know the name of the singer but i can usually guess what the name of the song is. In the end I have to remind myself it is free so can't complain to much

Awesome. 3d video plays side by side for vr and I don't even have to install a special player. I love the option to view and hear file before it finishes downloading to be sure its a worthy copy. I love you frostwire  always have always will. Ty. Only thing I would change is option to donate without something in return. IDC about ads. My son has regained speech cause of educational videos.

Review 5: Best music downloader It took me FOREVER and a day to finally find a music downloader like I used when I was a teenager 20 years ago. Frostwire is great  easy to use and fast. When my kids and I are being picky and don't want to listen to the radio or Pandora or our own music library  or there's a new song we HAVE to hear again and again  we can just pop on Frostwire and download to listen right then and also later  which is important because we can't just hop on YouTube every waking minute  nor do I want to.

But it has most of the songs...love it thank you creators and I'm happy...i use this all the time to download a lot of songs..my music list is pretty long thanks to this.....😍❤👏👏

Can you please fix  this is the perfect 👌 app just need a few adjustments.

Now  unread messages show before read messages regardless of date or time. Read messages do not show at all (they completely disappear from Unified Inbox) UNLESS YOU READ THEM WITH ANOTHER CLIENT (such as your desktop PC). If you read a message with another client  it will appear below the list of unread messages  completely out of time/date order. The Unified Inbox worked perfectly in older versions  but whoever has been modifying the code for this section of K-9 is essentially incompetent. There should be settings to configure the Unified Inbox behavior back to the old method if a user prefers that. It is after all the reason most of us switched to K9 in the first place. But the current behavior of showing messages read on another client in one way  and messages read in K-9 in another way  is just extremely poor development  and it needs to be fixed.

Review 2: I wanted to like it but there were simply too many issues. 1) I was unable to connect any academic accounts . Set-up was a breeze with my gmail accounts but anything with a .edu at the end refused to authenticate. I noticed that others have had issues connecting to exchange accounts but the support responses were always requests for endless additional bits of information with no answers. Generally  I'm willing to screw around with log-in issues like this for a very short time before gettiing irritated...especially when I know the log-in info is correct. This alone was enough to ditch the app. 2) the layout is uninspiring at best. The back button (to return to the list of accounts) is tiny and up in the corner of the phone and was very difficult to hit without triggering the phones drop-down menu. The big arrow that I constantly mistook for the back button just takes you to the next email. The search continues for an alternative mail app that works for me!

Review 3: I had used k9 for many years as there wasn't another email client nearly half as good or efficient  but the latest update has introduced a number changes that make it significantly slower to use. Bring back the """"""""""""""""mark all read"""""""""""""""" in notification pull down  and let us disable warnings such as confirmation required to""""""""""""""""mark all read"""""""""""""""" in main window. I think these two things will cost me half an hour a day managing my email on the go  that is 3 weeks in a year  I will check back in a few months if these are back. Update 5023 improved and fixed a few things  notification area still needs work  it's hard work trying to get the right message to show the options so you can delete or mark read when each has its own set of options and even Gmail doesn't split the options or message  change for the sake rather than good functional design  thanks for listening on the other things though.""""

Review 4: Great APP  Horrible widget For as long as I've been on Android  I've used K-9 email along with MailListWidget for K-9. For some reason  the MailListWidget is no longer available and I can't get it to install on my Note 7. So I now have no unread email list widget. Which means I'm using the standard Android email client. Why  after all these years have you not built a mail list widget?! I have always liked having a list of new emails listed right on my home screen and I could select the one I wanted to read. Now I have to open the client  hit each folder to find out what new emails I have. Love K-9  HATE the lack of widget support. Since K-9 doesn't meet my needs any more  I give it a 3 instead of the 5 I would give it on my Note 4 where the third party widget still worked. Wish K-9 had a native mail list widget.

Review 5: Huh? Still no single button for s simple reply. Still no pic resizing. Must be a fabulous development cycle. USE THE BIG TRACKER... which they've made so simple to understand. I went there  couldn't make heads or tails of it. So much for community. I have only been using it for a few months and right now what I find """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""surprising"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is that there seems to not be a single tap way of replying. I mean  are you pooping me? Other than that  so far it seems like it might be okay. But we'll see. UNFORTUNATELY  I actually stopped using it  because attaching pics  they go out full size. THIS IS ON A PHONE. Not like I've got the dexterity or inclination to work in multiple apps just to send pictures that won't use all my data.""""

Review 6: Edit: Still using K9 Mail. The most annoying thing about this app is deleting multiple emails. Rather than press and hold to enter into a """"select mode"""" where you then tap all your emails you want to delete  you have to press and hold each email and choose """"select"""". This takes ten times longer to simply delete multiple emails. It's rather painful amd annoying. All of a sudden I could no longer send email  only receive. I went to the server settings for outgoing mail  and clicked next and immediately got an error. I didn't notice at first  but after the update  www was added in front of my outgoing server. removed the www and it worked fine as it should. Thought I'd post this in the review section in case others come here with the same issue

Review 7: Loved this app but it suddenly started draining both data and battery. First warning was a text from my operator saying that I'd used 6GB mobile data in a couple of weeks last summer. Checked the phone and it was almost all down to K9. Disabled background data — hardly ideal — but I was prepared to give the program another chance. Final straw happened a few days ago when I experienced serious internet connectivity problems  only to discover that K9 Mail had used over 60GB of wifi data over the previous month. At the risk of stating the obvious  this is insane! Having persevered with this for years  I've now given up  uninstalled and gained about 3 hours battery life per day. Should be removed from the Play Store.

Review 8: WANT TO LOCK K-9 ??  TRY EMAIL LOCK....... available on Play store....... Its crazy that this feature is not already standard on a mobile email client! ! There isn't much not to like about this email client and it has worked flawlessly on test. But the only feature that is missing is access protection. I can't believe anyone could develop such a great client and miss out such an important security feature for a mobile device. I really don't want my email available to just anyone who picks up my phone. I am calling on the dev to add a password on start   or for another developer to make a plugin to add this missing important feature to K9 mail.

Review 9: This app used to be the best IMAP mail reader on android. But with two major problems  it has became quite useless on android ≥ 5 : - no way to “bounce” mail (redirect with full headers unchanged) ; - incredibly slooooooow to display mails. More than 1"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to display a mail  or to take a swipe in account. If you have an old android system  it is a MUST HAVE. Else  you better consider an alternative  such as Inbox or Cloud Mail  and it is a pitty. Nota : """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Show contact names""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  in Settings > Global settings > Display  have to be disabled in android 5+ as a workaround for the slow scroll & display.""""

Review 10: I've used this for over 4 years without any problems  however since the latest update and Android 7 it constantly stops syncing! I've made no changes and have managed to get it syncing again by changing the poll frequency but without warning it stops again? I found K9 when my stock email failed to cut the grade and this problem has forced me back only to find the stock app on Samsung is much better  so sorry K9 you've dropped the ball and I've been forced to move on. The syncing issue is all over the internet forums so it doesn't look like much is being done to rectify the problem. I may be back one day but I suspect not soon.",8166,K-9 was the best Android mail app available for years. The Unified Inbox in particular is a catastrophe.

com.fsck.k9,Positive,"Review 1: After trying a number of different apps  I was frustrated by the overkill so many of them thrust upon you. I wanted a clean  fast  truly useful app for using on my phone quickly and easily. After using K-9 Mail for a while now  I am completely happy with it. I appreciate being able to set the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""dark theme"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for one thing. I also appreciate being able to simply click on the icon and get an immediate  updated list of my emails with the first couple of sentences included. It is all easy to scan and scroll through without a lot of unneeded visual garbage or options. When you need an additional option  it appears at the logical place and time  not all the time whether you need it or not. Everything is easy to set and use  and K-9 integrates well with my Google email account. This is one of the very few apps of any type that I've found to be genuinely suited to and useful for quick-and-direct cellphone use.""""

Review 2: UPDATE: It's been my favorite mail client for years  it usually just works once you've set up everything. Perfect for IMAP. Though  with Android 6 you have to manually exclude K-9 from battery optimization  else it will stop receiving new mails. However: Ever since a recent major update  they changed parts of the GUI. In message view  attachments are now displayed at the very bottom. You have to scroll aaaaaaall the way down to even notice attachments. So easy to overlook  and to accidentally delete a billing mail because the first few lines looked like every other spam email. What were they thinking?? Give us an option to switch this back!

Review 3: Great email client for Android  if you have the skill and patience to set up your IMAP accounts manually. Ability to adjust FONT size is limited when using on a Tablet. On a high-res screen  you'll need your magnifying reading glasses. I'm running K9 on my Chromebook via the Google ARC Welder re-packaging environment. It works well except you can't deal with attachments because K9 doesn't know how to deal with the Chrome OS file system. (Chrome OS is lacking a complete email client for combining email accounts.) Build a Chrome OS version  and give us older folks larger fonts and this would be a five star app.

Review 4: Near perfect Android mail client  but with issues since Android 5 and 6 It's been my favorite mail client for years  it just works once you've set up everything. Perfect for IMAP. Only small issues: Since my switch to an Android 5 device  Android's menu soft-key (long-press Recents button) doesn't work any longer to open the menu in K-9. And since my device's upgrade to Android 6  K-9 seems to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""forget"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it has internet access after a while and stops receiving new mail by itself  and only continues once the device switches from 3G/4G to Wi-Fi or back.""""

Review 5: Not the prettiest application  but proof that looks can be deceiving. I have to admit  I was hesitant to take K-9 Mail for a spin because it's not much to look at and it didn't appear to offer anything particularly special... But whilst others may look pretty  I don't trust some of them as far as I can spit  so I decided to try-out K-9 Mail - and I'm glad I did! The everyday user will find that this is a fantastic e-mail client  while power users will be in heaven with the enormous amount of options and settings readily available... Battery usage could be improved though.

Review 7: K-9 Mail client is simply the best and the most versatile way of working with your inbox on the phone. I've been using it since 2009 on a number of Android devices and never had any issues with the app. Extremely fast  reliable and configurable  doesn't drain battery even with the frequent push-notifications enabled  has intuitive interface  and does exactly what it has to do. K-9 Mail is also smart enough to recognize necessary settings for the majority of ISPs  making the initial setup effortless. Thank you guys for this decent open-source software.

Review 8: Best multi account mail app Much more configuration options than mymail  better visually too  can be dark background everywhere. Wish this existed for desktop PC as well. I would prefer k9mail over Thunderbird anytime! Don't like the dog association  what does k9 have to do with email? Dogs are a huge waste of resources by the way. 8 billion humans weren't enough of a burden to our planet? But I digress.. Some complain about the interface being dated  but for me that's the reason it's the best app for email out there. Very efficient!

Review 9: clean  fast  simple  customizable It has a GOOD dark theme (very important to me); the interface is simple  easy to work with  intuitive  and highly customizable. If you're like me  you want an email app that keeps track of your email safely and simply  an app that doesn't bog itself down with glitz and bloat  and at the same time  doesn't sacrifice the option to add complexity or information detail the way many Google and similar ones do. K-9 does exactly what I want it to do simply and efficiently. And it's free  with no adds

Review 10: Great email client I have used K9 for years  since my Galaxy S1 and now on my Google Pixel with Android 7.1. I did notice sync randomly being disabled on the new device and found this is due to doze (battery save) in the kernel. Once I removed the app from doze it now works great as usual and with three accounts that sync at 5 10 and 30 minute intervals only uses about 6℅ battery life in a 14 hour period. I actively use K9 throughout the day to send mail as well  usually large mail with pictures. Best by far of all clients.",6228,K-9 Mail is one of the very few apps of any type that I've found to be genuinely suited to and useful for quick-and-direct cellphone use.

com.gelakinetic.mtgfam,Negative,"Review 1: Missing Love and use quite often. Has crashed on me a few times when making trades but nothing too minor. Only question is why the set list for Commander '16 hasn't been added yet  not have the reprints been updated with their correct price from the set and and major changes because of the reprint? Beyond that no complaints  and that in its own isn't even a complaint.

Review 2: Search function is totally broken. No matter the parameters i put in i get told there are no results. I'm pretty sure there are creatures in magic. I'm doing this review specifically because i love this app and i just don't want to stop using it. Will 5 star the moment i can search again

Review 3: Useful but lacking functionality I really like this application but when it comes to trading it's a bit lacking  would be better if you could check prices set by SCG as that is the norm for a lot of trades  also some issues finding foil value and saving a list of all tour cards

Review 4: Great app  but... It's a pretty fantastic app  but the general lack of Promo and Prerelease cards makes some trades hard to do (even if they're listed on TCGplayer.) and prevents the app from being perfect for all trades and card lookups.

Review 5: I use this app a lot when creating deck ideas  was 5 stars but hasn't been able to update with any sets after Kaladesh  it starts updating every set and then crashes partway through the list.

Review 6: Need new sets The new comander 16 set is not on here. The set has been out for months. Also the aether revolt sets not here either. It's been spoiled for weeks. Other then that it's perfect

As a judge  there are definitely some tools I use all the time  and need quick access to them. As an avid card trader  I rely heavily on the Trades tool that automatically populates market price for cards and calculates a trade's value for both parties in a simple and easy way. They update release notes regularly  and have all elements of the MTR and IPG in easy reach. The only MTG app you'll ever need to install!

Review 2: Fantastic resource I downloaded it as a way to organize my wish list and found myself using the rest of the app as well. A couple things I'd like to see  as others mentioned  the ability to select other price guides or websites  as well as the ability to see prices in different currencies as I'm not American.

Review 4: So many things to like This app is fantastic  packed with features  and even ad free. I wouldn't even mind ads or paying a few bucks for this because I've probably spent close to 20 - 30+ hours using this app. The only thing that I would ask for is a simplified sharing option of your wish list  for mass entry of cards into like deck builder  or a card buying site. The current way is nice with a text description of cards  but an option to have it the old way with just # of cards wanted followed by the name would be fantastic.

Review 5: Very nearly perfect Search is excellent. Quick and easy to use. The life counter is awesome. Displays a log  which is crucial  and keeps it even if you get a call or your phone dies or whatever. I've not played for two weeks and my score was still there! One critique: I'd really like to search for noncreature as a card type! ex. If I want to look at noncreature spells in standard  I have to search for instants in standard  then sorceries  then enchantments etc. Other than that and a few minor glitches  it's freaking perfect!

Review 6: Major savings The time and money I save using this app is phenomenal especially the trades options. I have used this free app to capitalize some good net returns. Some of it is speculating but most is having the knowledge and prices a finger poke away. The one bad thing I could ever say is that u have to keep force updating at least on Mondays or every other day if the markets fluxuating heavily like at set drops or pro tours.also I guess it should be a little harder to download the card image beyond a slight swipe 9/10

Review 7: I have no real complaints about this massive  user friendly database. This app is FREE! The developer really did the mtg  card-floppin fans a service unseen since the glory days of Inquest magazine. Couple that with a comprehensive rules index  up to date banned lists  deck builder  etc. and this simple app empowers new players while refreshing the rusting veterans.

Review 8: Almost there I love this app  but there is ONE THING you can do to make it better  please add a deck builder as well  after all you guys already have a lot of amazing features on this app  but to make it even better  and just mold it into the best card game app ever  which it kind of already is in my opinion  is adding a deck builder into it so that way I  and others  don't have to also download a deckbuilder along with this  when this already has a database built into it

It keeps saying there are no open issues for a milestone when I try to filter by that milestone - for each milestone. And I know there are issues for two reasons 1) when I view all open issues I can see that they're assigned to specific milestones  2) when i view in GitHub I can see lists of issues per milestone. This is the only functionality I need on mobile so the app is basically useless to me.

Review 2: Viewing line comments is awkward Most of the time  this app fails to load data for private repos. When it does work  it has another issue. My main use case for GitHub on my phone is to view and respond to line comments on PRs. This app shows line comments  but doesn't show the associated line nor its context  so I must switch to the file view to see that. Pretty awkward.

Review 3: Nice app  but I REALLY dislike how the app's back button isn't in sync with my Nexus navbar back button in terms of functionality. Using my navbar buttons does its back function right  unlike the app's back button which will sometimes exit the app even if I'm a few pages deep.

Review 4: Missing repos  so what's the point Logged in  manually went to my company's repo page  and it's missing repos. Doesn't seem to be any logic to it since I can see private repos  but it definitely doesn't have all of them.

Review 5: Private repos not shown The reply from developer didn't help  as I don't find private filter in the filter list. Also I find the app doesn't remember username and password so every time I need to type in password again.

It gets great speeds over ftp on all my devices and does not seem to over consume resources like many others. A slight learning curve to get the hang of it may be needed for novice users but the time is well invested. Even supports custom colors out of the box.Also supports private key authentication over ssh.

Review 3: Just loaded the app for the first time after looking for ES File Explore replacement. Well so far so good  that is until i tried the copy/move feature (which is an absolute must for me at the moment). There's no """"browse"""" option. If i want to make a spare copy of something for """"just in case"""" or """"testing""""  i would need to know EXACTLY what I'm typing out. I'm just learning  I'm not all THAT good/into it quite yet. The browse option would make things a bit easier for everyone and is honestly a great feature for all around. Thanks.

Review 4: Works great! No adds  easy to use  lots of plug-ins. It is GPL licensed  so you can check for yourself whether the code is safe to use  especially with your passwords and sensitive files. The only problem is something that can't be changed by the developers of this app: that my Android 4.0 device will not allow third party apps (including this one) to modify my external SD-Card.

Review 5: Whenever there's an add free app that survives off of donations I donate. There's a loyalty there a bond initiated by the developer.. I doubt I am the only one who feels and responds in a similar manner . Thank you Edit :just to add....There's nothing that compares to this..I mean I was able to delete several as in more than three apps because of this gem

Review 6: Most likely  this is what you want! After nearly 10 years on Android & countless file managers applied & tried  I've found none better than this one. Would be easily 5 stars if / when optimized for Microsoft OneDrive. (Should be simple plug-in as with others  high priority.)

Review 7: Powerful file manager that can modify external sdcards  but you have to select the """"storage access framework"""" option in the home panel. It would be helpful if this was shown clearly in welcome screens or in Play store notes. Some reviewers don't seem to have discovered it.

(at least for Gen) Not sure if it was my phone model/device fonts or the website mobile versions that throw off the tree branches but I've wasted at least two swords because poor weapon tree layouts.

Review 2: Useful and needs to be updated. It's lacking the newer event quests which I understand specific drop rates aren't easy to get but in context it would be nice to have the information so I know whether or not doing the event quest is worthwhile.

Review 3: Its alright but... It feels incomplete  menu gets in the way easily  the weapons page is a little hard to follow and what did me in is the armor page doesn't tell you what the total of skill points is.

Review 4: Lots of details need updating. Several event quests are not the right level  items are wrong  monsters are out of date  etc... Until this is properly updated with CORRECT info the 2 star will stay.

Review 5: Good info  but the armor filter crashes I love how it gives the information you need for the game  however the filter setting for the armor crashes the app whenever i try to use it

Review 7: Great app but there is a problem. Switch axe with poison phile are listed as having paralyze phile and vice versa. Hope this is fixed soon

Review 8: Eh Its not like 4U database. This one has a couple of really dumb mistakes that will get you clucked up.

Review 9: Don't see the point of this app. All this info i can get from the internet and the armor builder sucks

The app is not compatible with older versions of the game. There are no plans to release a free version of the app to the general public. It has been downloaded more than 100,000 times."
com.ghstudios.android.mhgendatabase,Positive,"Review 1: Awesome app! This is very helpful to me! It's only missing a few things. Fish locations outside Quest rewards sections  and I need to know locations of items you cannot buy or gather in Quests. Like  certain Trader item byproducts  what items to have the Trader get for you that has that byproduct item as a rare bonus  and tell me which items can only be obtained from Meownster Hunter rare areas. I need that added  as I have to resort to Monster Hunter Reddit  since most of the info not in this app is not on Kiranico  the number one place to look for Monster Hunter info for a few Monster Hunter games. Please add that missing info in the app if it does not lag it.

Review 2: It's a great database The database is very detailed and useful when I don't have Internet access. The one problem I have with this app so far is that the armor set builder isn't as flexible as it could be. I am currently unable to use a gunner helm on a blademaster set and vice versa. In addition  I am unable to mix low rank armor gear with high rank armor gear. Other than that  this app is great to use. Another recommendation I would have for this app is to add an achievements/awards page for some completionists. It's on Reddit

Review 3: Best MHGen App Ever! I absolutely love this app. I would recommend this app to ANYONE who plays the game and takes it seriously. I would not have made it as far as I currently am without this app. There is only one small feature that I think a lot of users would enjoy. It would be cool if there was another main tab on the left that had a list of armor sets (full sets)  so that we could easily check the skills of each full set without having to add each piece manually in the Armor Set Builder. Still a great app though! :)

Review 4: (almost) all the info you need for MHG. The """"""""""""""""MHGen Database is a very handy tool for all who plan on conquoring the game. HOWEVER: the section marked """"""""""""""""Palicos"""""""""""""""" is missing a couple things: The PALICO/PROWLER skills and support moves. Knowing how to obtain all skills for your loyal and (almost) fearless companions is a great tool that I personally recommend to be added in a future update. Every other thing in the application has all you need  and works like a charm.""""

Review 5: Very useful tool! First  if you're a hunter with a smart phone  get this app! It's a great guide for finding the small things you're looking for  like how to get a Commendation G  or the drop rate on Rathalos Plates. For the devs  would it be possible to include pre-requisites for quests? A line such as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Condition to Unlock: """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" would be perfect for aiding hunters and preventing confusion as to why they do not have a quests for an unknown reason.""""

Review 6: Needs updating on monsters plz There is a large amount of monster not included' such as the white and black monoblos!! Loa lang shung! Kusuala dora dragon! Blangonga! Kirin! And plenty of monsters! Those monsters is from monster hunter freedom unite and also add monster hunter tri 3 like the gobul and kraken and more!! The app is great but u need to add the monsters and what armor and everything! Or just add the generation seperate and u can seek what u wana find!!

Review 7: Does need an update for the more recent DLC that's been added  and I would love to compare weapons and armor side by side  but to be honest aside from a few smaller things I LOVE this app. It's made getting through MHGen soooo much easier. I love knowing where each monster spawns  what quests are key  and knowing what a weapons tree looks likes. Could use a better layout for the latter  but this app seriously rocks. Thanks for all the hard work on this app!

Review 8: Small flaws but perfect quick-ref guide! I access the weapons pages the most  so it is extremely informative on mobile and helps me find weapon trees fast and on the go. I see a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Final version only"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option  which is very useful for finding the best piece for certain sets  but please hopefully add a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sort by..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option in the future where we can sort by Raw  No. of Slots and Sharpness level!""""

Review 9: Flawless  but i have a idea Is there some way you could make the app sync to my game so i could see my materials so if i wanted to make the cosmic edge for example  it could tell me i have the accolade but am missing some other materials  then i now what to farm  and then maybe shows quests with highest chance to get the items?

com.gimranov.zandy.app,Negative,"Review 1: It's good  but needs to let the user know what's going on I'm very happy to have Zandy  and it does work. I'd give it 5 stars  except for: -What's going on when it's syncing? It pops up a little box  briefly  when syncing starts  and then when it's over. But I'd rather not sit there waiting for it. Zandy doesn't seem to handle the WiFi arrow very well  so that's a very unreliable way to tell if Zandy is busy or not. -Attachment downloading confusion: Zandy seems to start downloading another copy of an attachment when my tablet (Lenovo S6000) dims the screen  when I go to another app  or just kind of at random. There will be multiple download message boxes for the same item alternating with each other. Again  it's impossible to figure out what's going on. -Won't see attachments without parent items: This is just kind of annoying  but as far as I can tell if you have a file -- PDF  say -- that you've put in Zotero without yet creating a parent item  Zandy can't find it.

Review 2: Not good enough Have had problems syncing (no automatic sync) and it is impossible to open files via the webdav function (How does one do it?). Without this I think this app is not suitable for research; I organise all my working papers on Zotero and use a webdav cloud to sync everything. I would love a papership type app in my device  that would let me access and read the files. Android is behind ios in terms of research tools. Zandy is going in the right direction  but is not quite there yet (look at papership for good ideas!). Hope this is changed soon  I am willing to reconsider my review if this changes. The interface could also be a bit more polished and offer a white background possibility. (also  smart searches and tagging support would be welcome)

Review 3: Can't get new items to cloud (1) Altho it syncs existing items w/ cloud when changed (eg  added line to existing note)  can't get an item first created on Zandy to sync with (get uploaded to) the cloud. (2) The keyboard overlays bottom of Note and there's no scroll bar to move window's contents. (That's the same problem with this data entry right now on the play store  so maybe that's Android vs the app?) Downloaded Zandy today from Android app store on Samsung S4 running Android 5.0.1.

Review 4: Only option for Zotero and not a solid one The app works somewhat but it is very  very clunky. User interface is unintuitive. I still don't get how sync works as some collections show items within them and some dont. Bottom line - requires a lot of improvements before this app can be ready for primetime. This aint no papership like available for ios.

Review 5: Doesn't work on GT Crashes on log-in  'sync error' when API number is entered manually. I didn't receive help from the developers within three days. Requesting a refund. Android 2.2.  Samsung GT P1000 The latest update didn't solve anything

Review 6: Bad UI and bad features I am hoping that the developer will soon understand why so many users are frustrated with this app. This being the only Zotero app for Android  the app has huge market  if developed well.

Review 7: No group libraries support. No support for group libraries -- this isn't mentioned anywhere in the documentation. Completely useless to me without this functionality. I want my money back.

Review 8: Disappointing Doesn't show sync progress or history. Attachments must be downloaded manually one by one. No search. Poor interface. Zotero is great and easy whereas Zandy is disappointing.

Review 9: It keeps asking for login and key  even tho I was successful each time Can't get past login and key stage in order to get my collection.

Review 10: Works  but no shared libraries Most of my important references lie in shared libraries; unfortunately they don't show up in the app.",3805,Zandy doesn't seem to handle the WiFi arrow very well so that's a very unreliable way to tell if Zandy is busy or not.

com.gimranov.zandy.app,Positive,"Review 1: Very Useful App - One  hopefully fixable  problem Very Helpful on the whole I use this app frequently  both on my Blackberry Passport and on my Samsung Note 8. It syncs well with my Zotero references. My only concern is that I am unable to enter new references using ISBN numbers. When I enter the ISBN number using the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""add by identifer"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" command. the app seems to go into an infinite loop and never adds the requested information. This happens both on the Passport and the Note 8. This severely limits its utility for mobile use in libraries  bookstores  etc. If this problem is fixed  I would give it 5 stars.""""

Review 2: Solid mobile Zotero app with reliable sync Given the relatively low overall reviews  I hesitated to pay for and download this app. Now that I have  I have nothing but good things to say about it. Apart from a somewhat uninspiring UI  it does what it claims to do and does it very well  at least for me. I have had absolutely no sign-in problems and the sync has been flawless so far. I can't say the same for seemingly more popular and less functional (though prettier) reference manager apps out there. A refresh to the UI would get things to five stars  but I am still going to make very good use of this until then!. Well done  Avram!

Review 3: Definitely worth the purchase After being at first put off by the negative reviews  but seeing that it's getting regular updates and feedback from the developer  I decided to try the app. For now I'll mostly be using it for the WebDAV file attachment retrieval because the UI is still rudimentary. Some suggestions to mirror what has been said before : (1) a quicker way to access the attachment (an icon on the far right side for example). (2) integration with a pdf reader app after download completes (just an option to choose an app or at least to go to the folder where the file is stored). Keep up the good work.

Review 4: Good Idea. At first I gave a low score because I couldn't add content  just view. After being informed that I must be doing something wrong  I realized that some things can be added on the go. But - and I may just be technologically deficient  as this is my first smart phone - I can only add material to an existing folder already created in the full Zotero program. I cannot seem to use the app to start a new line of research from scratch. It is a very good idea. And I hope that the app is expanded - even if what is needed is user education.

Review 5: Good so far The app does a great job at pulling up my zotero information. I have not added anything to my account yet using zandy. I do have some suggestions. A sort feature would be nice to sort by date added  title  maybe author. An icon to indicate if there is an attachment to the reference item. Long press to copy information to clipboard  email reference info  export item  maybe generate citation. Look forward to updates.

Review 6: Solid Zotero library app for Android Downloaded this so I can coordinate my reading and sync my Zotero library when """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""on the go"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" while toting my Android tablet. I use webdav on my personal server space to store my files. It does everything I need it to do: stay synced with my online Zotero library and provide me the pdfs from my webdav space when I need them. Thanks Avram!""""

Review 7: Promising. WebDAV works after some wrestling (but not with http digest auth  alas--and attachment viewing takes a lot of clicks (3) and download time (compared to downloading in a browser)). I look forward to reading papers on this.

Review 8: Works great on my crappy wal-mart phone and nook color Sync works well and I can (eventually) find what I'm looking for. Not the most user friendly. I think if I used categories more on my Zotero then Zandy would be friendlier!

Review 9: Had its day  use others. Dev has left this to wallow for far too long. BibTex-based apps are the way to go  still keeping Zotero - check out Eratosthenes  autozotbib and zotero-better-bibtex.

Review 4: Great app but unreliable with comment change notifications (probably because Play Store is itself unreliable in reporting this info). I would suggest that rather than use the comment count  note the text of the very last comment made. It if changes  notify the user.

Review 5: Good but could be better Works quite good but I've found two UX shortcomings. 1. After clicking notification I'm being redirected to main app view instead to only those apps that have new notifications. 2. No summary for total revenue or downloads (for all apps)

Review 6: Great! The loading (synchronizing) time could be a bit more efficient. Or perhaps not automatically when you open the app so that you do not need to wait for it. Another thing is that you cannot read comments when the app is syncing which is a bit annoying.

Review 2: Overall quite great! Clean UI and lots of useful statistics without being overbearing. The absence of dividends is the only disappointment  as I would like to see that factored in to return. Even if I have to input it manually  it would be a worthwhile feature.

Review 3: Facing some latest news feed updates issue yesterday. Sent feedback and highlighted the issue to the team. The team responded quickly and worked to resolve the issue  everything was back on track then. Thumb up and keep it up folks!

Review 4: In previous versions  I couldn't add the Russell 2000 index along with a few other quirks  but all good now in 2.0.11. Thanks dev! For future versions  more chart options would be nice  particularly intra-day.

Review 5: I suppose I am a super-light user of this app  but it does exactly what I need  and easily. It was intuitive to set up the few stocks and mutual funds that I wanted to track  and I like the clean interface.

Review 6: Great app This is my favorite app for tracking my investments. Updates in real time  and the news is really solid. They are also very quick and responsive to any complaints. Keep up the good work!

Review 7: I've used this app for a while  but the latest update has made it excellent! I asked that they add previous close to the stock details  and it was there the next day! Awesome developers!

Review 8: The best choice for me as it watches the stocks I'm interested in in the background  and alarms me when it reaches my alerts. This way I can set it and forget about it.

It seems reproducing this only requires to delete an event in Google Calendar  without dismissing it in Calendar Notifications Plus.""""

Review 2: Just realised this app doesn't allow you to change the short notification sound to a long ringtone  or set the volume for the calendar alarm independently from the android notification volume. Damn  that was the main functionality I wanted  as C.E.R app no longer reliably fires. My mistake  re-checking the app description  it doesn't mention these features. Strange  as these are the most common features I would want. Persistence is handy  as is snooze  but not as important to me. Will un-install. Good lu

Review 2: I can snooze again! So far so good. Snooze is a required calendar feature for me and this app adds it back to the stock calendar without ads! In my limited testing so far  it works perfectly. I love that i can set the default action to snooze when I swipe away a reminder.

com.github.wdkapps.fillup,Negative,"Review 1: It's great!...but I actually love this app. It does what it's says it does without and fluff or needless frills. I bought a new car and started tracking my fuel from the first tank. I have always done this with paper but decided to go electronic this time. Unfortunately  my phone started acting up and I had to do a factory reset. We'll  I lost all my data. That sucks. This app needs a way to back up your data to Dropbox or Drive - preferably automatically. I took 2 stars off for that. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.

Review 2: Easy to Use I loved it once I got accustomed to it but a major improvement would allow users to enter in old data (from pen/paper) when one has an older car. The biggest issue for me is I got a new phone and lost all the data entered. My Honda is 12 years old and now I have a six month or more gap in my record keeping. So I am looking for a different app that syncs with all my devices. I am not going to convert to an excel file!

Review 3: I loved this app but I had to uninstall for a couple of reasons. One is after a hard reset on my phone  I could not get my backup back  so I lost about a year worth of logs. Secondly  this app had not been updated since last year. I miss this app. I would reinstall if this app is updated with a better backup or sync to backup.

Review 4: Silly questions You can't do anything with this app unless you know the capacity of your fuel tank. Reply to reply: I couldn't create a car without that number so everything else was grey. What use is the app if it doesn't know mileage? And what use is the capacity when no tank ever gets completely emptied?

Review 5: Charel Etsebeth Great app but...I agree with some other comments. 1 I can not make a backup of this and that is crutual to me. 2 can not print results 3 want to keep records for as long as I want. Not only for a year. 4 sometimes I want to work out consumption for a certain period. Not possible.

Review 6: Not flexible with units. I am used to the European system and want to see my consumption in l/100km. But I buy my gas in US and have prices per gallons. It is impossible to enter gallons fuelled and get this app to show you consumption in l/100km. So unfortunately  this app is not for me :(

Review 7: Horrible I hate the app. I attempted to use it and had to uninstall. I recommend using a higher quality app for any users. I highly recommend """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Fuel Buddy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" instead of this app  it is much more up-to-date and useful. You'll love it""""

Review 8: Why no cloud storage?? This would be perfect  but no cloud storage is a no go. I have used this for years but I don't want to risk losing my data. Moving to fuelio  I would stay but no cloud just doesn't work. It's 2016! Even my games auto save to the cloud!

Review 9: Incorrect calculations Filled up my tank 5-4-15 $32 @ 2.56 per gallon - only fillup for the month. Statistics for the same month show I spent $83 and average fillup gas price $3.11 for the same month - WRONG. I suspect its including my fillup from 2014

com.github.wdkapps.fillup,Positive,"Review 1: This is a GREAT app. I have been using it for YEARS already on all my vehicles. Very user friendly and easy to use. With the stats  plots and logs  it shows you everything. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating  is the fact that it does not auto backup to either Google drive or any cloud storage for that matter. This means that after putting fuel in my vehicles  I have to back it up every time. I did once all my vehicles data  due to not backing it up  and then my phone broke  and had no way to retrieve the data. If there is any way at all that it can be auto back-upped  that would make this app PERFECT in all respects. Even if I have to pay for the app then  it will be worth it.

Review 2: Absolutely excellent highly recommended ? Its very rare I give a full 5 ?'s  but this just one of those rare moments. This is one of the best most simplest apps for tracking fuel usage & costs. If all you need is to track fuel consumption with stats look no further. I would like to thank the Dev for a really good user friendly app. If you ever expand on this product  I have only one suggestion """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""general vehicle expenses"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" like registration  servicing  etc  just focus on the standard stuff. This is only a suggestion.? Keep up the great work Dev ?""""

Review 3: Great Accessory for Any Vehicle I've been using this app for tracking fuel consumption on my motorcycle as I take various trips around the country. Each trip is a different """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""vehicle"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for my purposes  and the resulting log makes a terrific recap of each adventure. IMHO this a perfect example of what a free app can and SHOULD be. The interface is clean and intuitive  and there are no ads. It has never locked up my phone or been glitchy in any way. Sure  there are things I WISH it did  or did differently  but FillUp works great as it is!""""

Review 4: Difficult if you have US vehicle in Canada I drive a truck that was originally sold in the US in Canada. So odometer reads in miles  but all our pumps are in litres. In order to use the app  I have to previously select the units  so no matter what unit in choose to work with  I need to take an extra step to convert the units to all one standard. That extra step makes it a hassle for me but I'm sure it's great for everyone else. Would be cool to have the option to record your miles down but pump in litres and have it do the calculations for you.

Review 5: Excellent App with fantastic support I'd been using another app to track my vehicle's consumption but I learned it was no longer supported when I went to transfer data & apps to my new S7. Enter Mr. Kramer who replied to my email & said he could & would rework my .csv file to work with his app. This before I had even downloaded the app! And the very next morning I had the revised .csv which imported easily into this new app. So I now have all my data going back to 2010 without a hitch. This app works well and has lots of informational display!

Review 6: Needs 2 things for perfection It's very simple to use and overall I love the app. It needs to have a way to link the data to google drive (or dropboox  skydrive  etc) for automatic backup. The manual backup and reinstall approach went out in the 90s. Get with it! There should also be an option to print the log directly. That is a huge shortcoming! As it is you have to export a csv file into a spreadsheet  create the column headers  format the page the way you want it and then you can print the log. Crazy! Overall a great app though.

Review 7: I love this app. few changes though like I said  I love this app it is very simple to use and keeps all the info that I at hand. I do however have two changes I would like to see 1: i would like to be able to see and transfer data between devices. 2: i would like to be avle to have informtion saved longer than a year. or at least be avle to look on how previous years have been on fuel. Once again great app just a few tweeks to be done  strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to keep track of fuel  millage  or cost

Review 8: Great app I have used this app for a couple of years now  and I LOVE IT! Two suggestions though. 1.Would be great to have 2 users edit the same log with a shared vehicle. I had a problem getting my hubby to save receipts when he filled up  so maybe if he could make a direct entry. I don't know if it's feasible  but just a thought. 2. I would like to add maintenance records such as oil changes  new tires  brakes  etc. I would be willing to pay for these extra features.

Review 9: Used to like this app but...UPDATED I want everyone that reads these reviews to know that this is a great app. I received great tech support from the app creator himself and no longer have an problems with the app. (I have used this app for nearly 2 years but it will not allow me to import my data log from my Note 4 to my Note 5. The app stops when I try to import the csv file from my One Drive account. It's there something I can do or a different version?)

Review 10: Awesome!!! I can only confirm a review I read below. Used to have another app on my S5 that doesn't work on my S7 anymore...so I downloaded this one and sent my export data to Mr. Kraemer. Less than 24 hours later he answered with my reworked .csv files. Imported those and all works fine. 5 years of fill ups with 4 cars saved. Great app  great service  awesome developer.

com.gmail.jerickson314.sdscanner,Negative,"Review 1: im not sure there is any real point unless theres a device too stupid to know when a new file was added and automatically count it in the list (sounds like some devices werent thought up carefully but whatever). as for my device anytime a new file is added its automatically counted  which is odd for a piece of garbage device like mine. the external storage is auto-scanned anyway upon mounting so this app seems pointless to me  but it is fun to goof off with so ill give that much. in any case my only problem is that despite specifying the directory (external) it still scans the internal. but it also scans the external as well. now if we can get it to only scan the specified and not the other as well (if the file path is /sdcard0 it should only scan sdcard0  if its sdcard1 to only scan sdcard1 - not both). also we should also be allowed to not put /storage/ or /mnt/ before .... if i want to only put /sdcard0/ it should scan even though /storage/ wasnt added. the reason is because it should already know the /storage/ (or /mnt/) part so we shouldnt have to specify that in the directory. just where its going from there.

After downloading other music player that also did not work  i read about a media storage bug and that you should delete data and rescan.

com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Negative,"Review 1: Had to try codes over 20 times to even set up the google authenticator account Its an interesting idea to keep accounts safe but it doesn't work properly. I had to enter a code to set up my google authenticator account over 20 freaking times and it just wouldn't take the code  and when these codes are timed  it gets overly frustraiting and stupid. I tried each and every code with a a space too since it wasn't accepting the codes without one either. It FINALLY decided to work after 10-15 minutes of trying and alot of anger and frustration. So like I said  its an interesting idea for account security...... WHEN IT DECIDES TO WORK! Hopefully  you fix this problem before I'm forced to use this app for verification purposes again cause if it pisses me off like it did the first time  its bye bye app and hello new app that actually works properly! NOT IMPRESSED OR HAPPY ABOUT THAT. At this point  I would NOT recommend this app to my friends.

Review 2: Well this program was used in the hacking of my gaming account on Warthunder  I managed to gain access back into the account via their support system with proving that I am the real owner of the account. Their support staff kept insisting that using this crap is the best way to protect my account and now that I have access back into my account I should re activate this 2 step process using this APP. So I took their advice and although I had gone through and changed my password about 5 times that day the hackers could still access my account because of this APP  I tried to deactivate all other devices to no avail they could still gain access even after password changes  deactivation of this app being used for access to my account and then reactivation. Serious security issues with this APP and how people can not protect their accounts once recovery processes have been started and completed.

Review 4: The app itself is great  having the same issue others have had with changing phones. My old phone broke  and I got a replacement phone (still using the SIM card from my old phone) and I still can't link my accounts. I was able to re-connect my google account (because of the text option) but nothing else. If you are on the same google account  with the same phone number as before  you should be able to sync with the other accounts you had on the authenticator. I had 2-step verification with my bank account  and now I can't log in because it needs a code. But the only way for me to get codes in the app on the new phone is to re-add the bank account  which I can't do because I need to be logged in to my online banking in order to generate a barcode or key. I'm trapped!

Review 5: Dear Google  Fisher Price Is For Kids!! GOOD GRACIOUS GREAT BALLS OF FIRE  what on earth did you guys do to the UI? A 5-star security app  no doubt  but the new UI & icon are absolutely hideous lol. The bright white material design is not only hideous but it's also an unnecessary power drain on AMOLED screens!! It's bone headed decisions like this that makes people switch from Android over to Apple. So what I did was rollback to the previous version  disabled automatic updates  and detached the app from Google Play using Titanium Backup. Also made sure to create a schedule every 6 hours to keep detaching the app as a workaround for Google’s reattachment scheme.

Once you loose the company app code you have a hard time retrieving it especially when you need the code also to gain access to the account on the third-party website and no proper support is provided to disable two-way authentication. example: I can't access my teamviewer anymore because I reinstalled google authenticator and it's asking for code which I can't get on the site without providing security code from Google authenticator. Would be great to have an authenticator that remembers the apps scanned and retrieve it once you provide your google account credentials.

Review 8: Ye I get it 2 factor auth is supposed to be bound to a specific device. But no backup feature means you are seriously boned if anything happens. Get Authy or Auth Plus  anything but this. Or if rooted you could use Titanium (or manually backup the App settings) but why  just why? Which brings me to another point. On a rooted device this PoS is absolutely NOT secure. The settings are not encrypted at all  they basically assume your phone is secure which Google obviously knows isn't always true  not to mention that they have no control over that. Well done Google  wanna be secure when its inconvenient for the user but too lazy to encrypt what you are trying to protect.

Review 9: Google Authenticator popularized two-step authentication all over the Internet  and for that alone it deserves a lot of credit. It has numerous shortcomings  however. The user interface is poor -- account names and the timer animation are too small to see comfortably. There is no PIN  which could have been used to store the secret keys encrypted. If somebody steals your phone  they can extract all the secrets from the phone's flash memory. There is no way to back up secrets or transfer them to a second device. Even though I use Google Authenticator all the time  I do so only because there is no good equivalent and trustworthy replacement.

Review 10: I couldn't get the app installed onto my Andriod device. Also  I could not end or go through all the steps needed to verify. I realize we have to switch to varios IT and cellphone devices to enhance security. But if so many actions  going back and forth  confirming and reconfirming! Then frankly it's too much of a mess!! It's like that forest of cables and wire connections at the back of my laptop  DT Computer  Printer  etc.  etc.  TOO MUCH TROUBLE for little Worries!!! No woneder older folk don't care to use these many fangled devices!!! YOu spend your entire 24 hrs wanting to browse and use your computer or cellphone! Why Bother???",7694,The app was used in the hacking of my gaming account on Warthunder. I had to enter a code to set up my google authenticator account over 20 freaking times and it just wouldn't take the code. I tried each and every code with a a space too since it wasn't accepting the codes without one either.
com.google.android.apps.authenticator2,Positive,"Review 1: i'd like to think that an easier way could be worked out  but the app does work as described. How many steps there are to complete the setup would be good information up front. For me  the first two codes too about 10 minutes to arrive. since I was expecting them immediately  I did the 3rd one  which worked. The one issue that I have is how to get to the message then back to the screen where it should be entered. I did it  but it was quite clumsy. It would be great if the code could show itself on the page that's already there. There are a couple of weak spots in either my understanding of how it's done or the coder's planning  but this is a well working app.

Review 2: Missing Features. (But I still Love it) I see you guys Support for multiple accounts. But can you make it so we can Group Accounts under the same Parent Account. Let's say if I have different Facebook accounts .. or different Microsoft Accounts. Give us the Option to Group Accounts under the same Domain or Parent Account. which would make it easier to find. Also when you add an Account..The Last added account should be at the Top of the page. Not at the Bottom  so you won't have to scroll down. If not.. at least give us a Sort Menu that has the Option to View - Newest First. A Million Thanks in Advance.

Review 3: Listen your users. Accept constructive criticism. Lets make GA THE best app for 2FA. You are already late... GA should be 2FA 👑 (the best app for twofactor auth.) -1.) Add fingerprint sensor auth. Easier than codes. 2.) Support """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Tap to approve"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (great feature!) for ALL  not just Google services. Poput/tap is lifesaver! 3. Enable backup & restore  but not only for EXISTING phone (what if lost?)  but for ANY new device - protected with passwd for instance. and  4.) Windows version of GA is a must. More availability on deskop  please. Bring significant progess! 💚""""

Review 4: EPIC SECURITY FAIL! This app requires a 3rd party QR code scanner called ZXing Barcode Scanner. As instructed by Google  I get the App from Play store. Then scan the QR code shown on Google 2-factor setup. I clicked the screen in ZXing QR scanner... WHAMO! ZXing barcode """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""app"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" takes me to a scam web site (LuxQuiz) offering me a free iPhone 6s! But only after I give them my credit card info for the $1.99 shipping fee! Gee  thanks Google for partnering up with such a solid 3rd party. UN_BELIEVABLE!!! Get it together Google.""""

Review 5: Can't Migrate App Accounts to a New Phone! As a Google partner we use & sell Google products & advise our clients all the time to use the native apps for the best experience. We use the Google Authenticator App to lock down accounts for ourselves & our clients and I have 30 or so accounts configured. I purchased a new phone and being a Google fan I purchased the Nexus 6P. Everything just works after I login to Google except I find out I can't migrate the accounts in the Authenticator App and have to go and set them all up again. This needs fixing!

Review 6: It's simple  gets the job done  and I wish more services supported it  this is by far my preferred 2FA solution. In terms of gripes: I'd love for the credentials to be a bit more tightly spaced. If you have a lot of accounts  you may need to scroll. Additionally  it'd be great to have a friendlier way of displaying the codes when logging in through the mobile browser or standalone mobile app. Perhaps make it possible to show select codes on notification bar for a brief time?

Review 7: Google is awesome. Have a suggestion..... Right now there is one password for my google account. I think having individual passwords for specific google service would be very helpful. Example: I have a password that will only allow me to access my Google Music. That way I can log into a friends laptop at a party and enjoy my music collection with friends without having to worry about anyone accessing my Gmail  Google+ or any other Google service.

Review 8: It just works. Works with lots of other services other than Google that require 2 factor verification like Snapchat. And I also heard there is a new material design  dark theme mode and in app scanner!. I'd wish to have Cloud/Backup in a case where you can't access your codes like Authy does. Maybe integrate with Google Drive. Be able to access it anywhere like the web. And if possible push notifications when someone is logging in.

Review 9: Well  some support would be nice... It does exactly what it says on the tin. It's pretty much idiot-proof. So far  so good. And then you look over at iOS. This app was last updated in 2013. The iOS app was updated earlier this year  has a material design icon  and would fit far better into the rest of the UI on a device running 5.0 or up. Kinda sad that Google are better at supporting their own apps when on a rival platform.

Review 10: I had used this app earlier and lost access to my few accounts because I had to format my mobile. There was no option to recover the accounts linked to this app after reinstalling it. Now I am using Authy authenticator app which has all the required features and it is awesome in features and performance. Whether backup of all linked accounts possible with this app now? What if the app got uninstalled accidentally?",5314,The app does work as described. There are a couple of weak spots in either my understanding of how it's done or the coder's planning.

com.google.android.diskusage,Negative,"Review 1: Waiting for a response UPDATE: ---------Ivan responded  but doesn't think his APP is the cause. I don't know what happened  but I was able to recover my files using RECUVA. That was all I really needed. It might have been a fluke. ---------- Installed this app because the amount of storage left on my phone has been low and I wanted to see what apps/files were taking up the most space and move them over to my SD card. Tried to play a song later in the day and the media player said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""this file type not supported by media player"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I thought it might be a fluke  so I restarted my phone. Same thing again. I opened the files tab in my apps menu  and that's when I saw that my phone had over 8 Gb of space(it was at 4) and my SD card had 29(it was 17) All the files I had that were not associated with running an app have been deleted. I contacted the developer and am currently waiting for a response. If this is fixable  I will remove this rating. The thing that bothers me the most is the pictures of my daughter were on the phone. There was absolutely no warning that this was even remotely possible.. I have had other apps asking for permission to access files  and not one has ever done this.""""

Review 2: Finally a way to know WHAT is actually using ALL THAT SPACE! My wife & I both struggled with internal storage too full to install apps or take more photos  and running that low on storage also seems to cause phone problems in general. While the built-in storage tools is really good at showing you that all your space is gone (duh)  it's not much help in solving the issue. DiskUsage makes it dead simple to narrow down to exactly what folders and files are using that space and even what apps are responsible. Note: DiskUsage does not actually fix your problem or clean up files--it gives you the intel necessary for you to do that. Deciding what to delete and what to move and where to move it is still a bit of a technical exercise that might frustrate a lot of people.

Review 3: Compact app fit in the limited space I had available and instantly showed me that my Podcasts and Audio Books were consuming 3gb of space on my phone. One of the apps (Overdrive library app) had already been set for external storage but had not migrated files downloaded into system storage prior to the setting change. When I changed the settings in the podcast app (Podcast Addict) it automatically moved the files to my SD Card. I deleted the audio book files. This isn't the first time I'd been searching the forums for help with my management  this will be the first place I look next time I'm having a storage problem.

Review 4: I was Mislead by an External Link I installed this app  following an extternal link to it in an article written on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""reclaiming the memory on your Android """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or something along that meaning--not the memory on my SD card. And  now  on coming back here and seeing the sd card subheading  it was the link and not the app. Still  not what i needed.""""

Review 5: Not as good as tears Don't understand all the positive reviews. Although it list large files in descending order  upon highlighting a file I'd like to delete  it doesn't allow me! I get a repetitive error indicating """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""error  cannot be deleted"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with no other explanation. Just not allowing me to delete.

Review 7: I had been aggravated by my phone for over a month or so as to why it kept giving me a low storage space error. After moving quite a few apps to the SD card I was still having issues. Finally after Googling it and finding this app it told me it was the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Download Manager"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" cache taking up over 2GB!

Review 8: I could just use treesize on windows when on mass storage But samsung had the wise idea of disabling mass storage  now I have to recopy files to my temp directory just to play an MKV video? and now I get annoyed by conversion prompts whenever I copy a boat load of MKVs to my sdcard? samsung your stupidity is boundless this app works

Review 9: I have a doubt The total space on my phone memory is 150.5 MB  so using this app I discovered the apps on my sdcard are taking up 45 MB and the apps on my phone are taking 35.2 MB but I still have 90 MB free. I do not understand why the three add up to 150 MB  even it displays the it as 170 MB. Could spmeone please explain this.

Over my last few phones this app has become one of my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""day one"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" apps. I love Sequoia Viewer on my desktop and this app is a lot the same  if not better. It's lightweight  fast  no bugs  and no ads. I like that we can now open right up to the location with a file explorer app. It's phenomenal at allowing you to get an overview of your storage and where garbage might be hiding. On my s7 I found over a GB worth of Photoshop app files on my local storage but I never used it on this phone (snapseed is better).""""

Review 2: BEST OF ITS KIND Heres a rare app cos its top quality & free of ads. Its functionality is amazing although u do need another file explorer app to view most content but nearly everyone has one of these on their device anyway so I think its smart of the developer not to increase app size turning this into a file manager when its not needed. Its simplicity but at its best & I absolutely love the left to right tiered view. Its better than any others ive found at helping work out where space is gone & ive tested dozens of others

Review 3: Simple way to really delete """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""evasive"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" trashed files My """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""miscellaneous"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" files kept growing to 19GB as I deleted hundreds of old photos. There was NO system option to permanently delete the files (that I could find) on my Galaxy S6. This app immediately identified a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""trash"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" folder with 10GB  which I deleted with this app; the miscellaneous folder size was reduced commensurately and immediately! I obvious side effects so far. Thanks!!!""""

Review 4: Amazing must to have program! If you use program like WinDirStat on windows you know that seeing your volumes with graphics that show how much everything takes makes deleting those way much faster and you find files that you would not otherwise. I recommend this to everyone! Few minor upgrades would be nice like ability to switch to explore mode where you see directories as per detailed view and would see their size too but there is other program for that but everything integrated to one would change this to Epic status :)

Review 5: All apps should be as good as this 😁👍 You can't ask much more from an app  and this has what I need: No Advertising  Simplicity  Small file size  Zoom from screen  and more. If you used Windirstat on a Windows PC  you'll appreciate this...and it's faster! Like Windirstat  the only function I would add would be the ability to transfer and backup files to some external location like a cloud or PC wirelessly  but that would add more to the file size  wouldn't it? Overall  this is a fabulous app.

Review 6: Great  simple and Very Very useful for finding files taking up space on internal & external storage. Best feature is looking at installed app sizes and how much space it's data is taking up at a glance and being able to tap on the data and select view from the drop down menu to be taken straight to the app's info page to clear the data and then press back to go straight back to searching for files again: ) RELIABLE SMALL IN SIZE FAST AND EASY TO USE what else could you want in an application

Review 7: Great app with great support. Emailed dev Ivan  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""What exactly does 'System Data' refer to? Files your app can't read? Files on the same partition  but not located in '/data'? I need help understanding how this part of your app works."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Got a same day response  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""'System Data' is the difference between all files DiskUsage found on a partition versus occupied space (total - free) reported by the partition."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" This app was a great help!""""

Review 8: Amazin simple and intuitive Simple and super intuitive design! Helped me spot all memory heavy files in 15 seconds. The app is not intrusive and does not require any other permissions apart from accessing memory. I usually don't leave reviews  but the author definitely deserves 5 stars! One advice to improve the app is to add """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""open"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" functionality directly to the block of file eliminating the need to click on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""show"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button""""

Review 9: FANTASTIC! This is perfect!! I love how it lays EVERYTHING out in such a smooth  beautiful  and efficient way! I was able to find out what was taking so much space - I have a dumpster app that basically allows me a second chance to delete things (pretty much a recycle bin like you'd find on a computer). I forgot about it  and turns out that I had 36 GB of what I THOUGHT was deleted  but in reality  wasn't. I was able to find this out with this app! Thank you! 12/10 recommend! 😄

Review 10: Quick and efficient I downgraded to 3 stars as it only supports solid explorer to browse directories. Very easy to traverse all the directories. Great UI. Small  not bloated. No ads! I got a little confused with the media category. It should be distinguished as a category  not a directory  using a different color/font style.

Review 6: I have never reviewed an app before today but due to the massive inconvenience this app has caused me I felt it was only fair to warn other's about this update. Within minutes of the last update  the message """"unfortunately google play services has stopped working"""" has been popping up on my phone every 30 seconds or less and none of my google apps work. I've tried EVERYTHING to fix this  every single method I've found online  I spent an hour and a half on the phone yesterday with my phone carrier's tech support while they tried sending a few updates and fixes remotely to my phone  but nothing worked. I was told my last option was a factory reset and if that didn't work then there's nothing more they can do but send me a new phone...IN 7 to 10 DAYS. As for the reset  it didn't work because the message """"google playstore stopped working"""" kept popping up and stopping the process! I've contacted google numerous times thru email (cause there's no other way I can find) but have never received a response. Now it looks like sending in my phone and waiting 7-10 days is my only choice...SO BEWARE!

Review 7: I want to share my painful exp. It has not worked for months. Not sure what google did. Many app including Youtube needs google play to connect. To do it  google play service is needed. Google play service has not work. Tried all the trick. Enentually reset. I did &gt;20 times. Still not work. That leaves rooting. I decide not to Dr o. If reset is not working  roting may not help. Cant save n retrieved game. YouTube not working. I download to factory version. That works. Not really  many clips are not supported. The one that supported  the clip keep skipping. Google want us to use play service  so it can collect our data. Fine  the app n YouTube r free. Of course  uber wants us to play. Not going to do it if google refuses. I search internet. The prob start at least 2 yr ago. According one article  despite &gt; 800k ppl complain  google is not going. My advice do not download. Actually  not downl load mean the device is useless  just dont buy android dev. The rumor i heard is it f as ills on okder device. Sounds like google plant bug to force to upgrade. Sorry not going to doit

Review 8: Tell Google what I think  well I'm not a great fan of Android due to incompatibility with this system .updates from any apps can cause problems  meaning an app might work on one device but not on another. You buy an app (but not anymore for me) then it gets an update and it does not work. I had a problem with the wifi icon greyed (wifi still worked even though grey means not connected) out rather than have a blue icon past several months. Googled the problem but not much luck with the solution. I deleted all the updates still no luck then deleted a piece of software called GOOGLE SETTINGS connected to GOOGLE PLAY SERVICES which was a previous update. By doing this it brought back the familier blue wifi icon to let you know you are connected. Unfortunately the latest update of Gmail crashes too on android so have rolled back to the factory version. I've been a great fan of Google for decades since they came on the scene  but Android versions does not cut it for me PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES. Sorry to say if I can give no stars I would  so my score for this software 0/5.

Review 9: Ok so now my app keep crashing/force closing. I did a factory reset  that didn't work  I downloaded the latest NEXUS 5X BULLHEAD OTA IMAGE from the ANdroid Developers website and installed it via ADB. It's working now but I lost all my data and still sometimes I get a Force Close Message. I've never rooted or modified my phone in anyway that could void my warranty on my Nexus 5X. I had to downgrade my Google Play Services App by downloading an earlier version of it from apkmirror to get my phone to work and open apps but it's still not at %100 working stability. Nexus 5X and 6P are supposed to be the last two Nexus phones that are still getting support even though the Pixel Line was made to phase out the Nexus line. That's fine  but when I end up buying the Pixel or Pixel 2  If I still have this same problem  I'm returning the phone and buying an iPhone as much as it pains me. I've been using ANdroid ever since Froyo! I use pretty much all your google services. Shouldn't that count for something? So disappointed! -__-

I think the Google Play app in order to distinguish itself from the competition which is becoming better and better must include more possibilities for the user to search for apps to buy or freely install: 1) possibility to search only apps that are free 2) possibility to filter out apps that require specific permissions 3) obviously the possibility to search for apps that do not require any special permission 4) possibility to arrange results in order of proce  number of required permissions  name  and so on You must give more power to the user... the user must not feel limited in power as is the case now!!! This is very important.. if you havn't thought about it yet then it is time to do so.. if you have and not applied these changes yet..it is time to change your managers! cheers!

Review 3: I am continually amazed at the beautiful simplicity of the products  especially Google Play  that are available to me  and the rest of the world. I know  just from a few minutes of logical evaluation  how much hard work and cutting edge thought goes into these products. """"User Friendly"""" is a massive understatement. Walk by any Apple Store and observe the frustrated and confused customers that are required to go back there and literally take classes in order to operate their phones  apps. and the rest of the subpar products on offer. And   check out their depleted bank accounts  you must pay for just about everything. No """"Google Play"""" there  just poor choice for overpriced  overly complicated  cheesy products. Samsung and Google are the best you can do. Jimmy Brown.

Review 8: HTC ONE M8 running Kitkat (4.4.4). Latest version 10.2.98 (038) has been much more stable and gentle on battery. All versions after 9.0.82 (038) had bug - Play service continously keeps device awake (even when no apps running  WiFi off  data off  Bluetooth off  GPS off  Auto Sync off and screen off). Latest version 10.2.98 (038) has the same problem but is better/improved than other recent versions. There are still unnecessary wakelocks causing battery drain. The issue completely resolved when I downgraded back to 9.0.82 version - so this is clearly NOT a hardware/battery problem.

com.google.android.marvin.talkback,Negative,"Review 1: Pre-installed app on Samsung Galaxy 3 & I didn't need it so I started by turning it off. However  any time the phone is restarted the app starts up as well & tells me so by placing a left hand print in the corner of my screen. Got so annoyed w/it (& the process of having to go in to the settings  go thru 3 steps to turn it off  not to mention having the app yell at me if I forgot to turn my volume off) that I disabled the app but it's STILL happening! So  now I've come here to re-enable the stupid app just so that I can shut it off again because since disabling it  it doesn't show up in the settings anymore but still  somehow gets activated. I'm sure it serves its purpose well for those who truly need it & I think it's a great idea  but for me it's just a nuisance. It can't be uninstalled  just disabled but clearly that doesn't work. Any suggestions would be great...please help!!!

Review 2: Without any shadow of doubt in this world (or the next)  this is the worst app that I have stumbled upon in my whole life. If you are very profoundly disabled (which  fortunately  I am not)  I fully accept that it (just) may be the best thing since sliced bread. But if you are NOT so disabled  then do yourself a massive favour  and RUN A MILE!! Why?? Because once you have downloaded it onto your phone or laptop  you will find it is the worst anti-social virus you have ever experienced. I absolutely HATE it!!!! It almost makes me wish that I had never been born!!! This so called 'app' makes me wish that I did not own a mobile cell phone! The one that I used to own (before I discovered this app)  I went to the expense of hiring an expensive digger  to enable me to crush it beyond all recognition. And I then started again - without this life-destroyer.

Review 3: Needs alot of work still. Not much use for people that are Truly disabled and handicapped. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎 I am Very Disappointed that Google hasn't made this application a thousand times better  than this application currently works. A person with disabilities or a handicap such as myself really find this app pretty worthless. I say this because it needs way too much work still before it will work correctly for people that are disabled and handicapped. It WAS a great idea with but with TERRIBLE IMPLEMENTATION by Google. This application is way more useful to people with no handicap at all.

Review 4: Im having a problem with google talkback on my galaxy s7 I downloaded a game called dice world. When I downloaded the game. Talk back does not let me click on the boxes in order for me to fill out my username and password. Instead I have to click on the sign in button in order for me to fill out my information. When I am finished filling out my information I have to turn off TalkBack in order for me to sign in and play the game. I Uninstall the game and reinstall the game but nothing happens I also uninstall TalkBack and reinstalled talk back but nothing happens

Review 5: I find this app is a total waste of space  google talk back can now listen in on my conversations  read my textes or messengers and and fabricate my words into a voice  its soon they will control the minds of humans  sounds like a world order domination take over. They want us to spend more time on our phones and devices and allow these apps & softwares to function do everything a human can do. Im a human i dont need a robot to do things for me. So no thanks im good and ill be sharing this with others. I like to be out doors and connect with nature...

Review 6: This app is a great concept and I am happy to have it but it has its flaws. The predictive text as always anticipating what I might say because I used the same type of conversations but many times it will miss type words or put in what it thinks I said. When I end a sentence it will write out the word question mark or the word period or whatever else I need to use. Unfortunately I am always stopping and have to erase what the app puts in and sometimes it won't even type anything in. Speak very clearly into this app but it has its own mind sometimes

Review 9: If this app is by mistake opened or activated then you have to run a software to deactivate it which costs around ₹250-₹300 averaged in India . Once it's ON A then you cannot switch off by your own handling like swiping the screen. The only first part which a screen shows of the menu is accessible. If you tried to swipe it down or swipe Right to access view another menu icons you cannot unless you deactivated by a software from mobile shop. If it got activated then understand your mobile will stay hang forever or fucked..... Hated it

Review 3: Great improvement over last version For those that say that TalkBack is annoying  and should not be installed on devices  think how you would feel if the rest of the world could access all this wonderful technology that we have  but you could not. On Android  TalkBack is an essential app for a blind person to navigate the mobile world. TalkBack works very well for me  and I use it everyday. The only thing that I would ask Google  is please better trained your support technicians on the use of TalkBack.

Review 5: Please Add a TalkBack Widget! Much improved from 4 years ago! Thank you for improving this app. My only pet peeve now is that there is no TalkBack widget and the two-step shortcut in stock Android on a Nexus 6p is rather cumbersome  and if you don't time it right you accidentally end up turning the phone off! Please add a widget so that low vision users can toggle Talkback on and off with the press of ONE button  or add the ability for users to turn TalkBack on and off with Google Now.

com.google.android.stardroid,Negative,"Review 1: I don't know what you guys did  but this app used to work perfectly on my previous phone  but that phone put himself to sleep. Now that I got myself a slightly better phone  I get a message stating that I don't have either a gyroscope or an accelerometer. Well  I do have an accelerometer. I set the settings to what it's supposed to be to make the app work... It's all shaky and inaccurate af. And to make it even more annoying  I keep getting the same message when I boot the app on  even though the settings are already set to work. I have a Samsung Galaxy On5. Please fix this. I don't want to get rid of this app that used to be so amazing. And yes  I unchecked that gyroscope function

Review 2: Screen overlay detected error... Avoid apps that require screen overlays to be disabled. This is one of those apps. The problem is  even if you disable all overlays  this app often still complains that an overlay is detected. This is simply nothing more than bad programming. There are other astronomy apps out there that do not suffer from this limitation. In my case  I could never get it to work on 2 out of 3 of my devices  no matter what I tried. The only reason it works on the third device is because I did a factory reset  then installed it. However  because it pops up this error  I uninstalled it from all my devices and I use another app instead.

Review 3: So i woke up at 4am  look out my window  and i see this flashing white thing in the northwest sky. At first i thought it was a plane but it didn't seem to be moving much. So i brought my Skymap for the first time ever and i believe I was able to identify the star Deneb! And another star in the northern sky that started with a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""D"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" too. So the only complaint I have is about myself  because my close vision is horrible and had trouble reading the text  i need reading glasses  so that means I SUCK  not the app  get it? (user Kelly G. with the shi**y phone  but give the app  2 stars  huh?) lol""""

Review 4: On my Samsung Galaxy S3: Pretty well made app but... After fiddling with it  including finally force closing it & deleting its data  it's finally showing things accurately when I first open the app. It used to start with things showing as they'd be at the following day's sunset. The only real issue I see left is that it tries to scroll/pan diagonally when I roll my phone(horizontal orient) to look up/down or turn left/right. It corrects itself  I think due to the magnetic correction setting  but it's pretty annoying because it makes things EXTRA shaky. :/

Review 5: Okay but it cannot locate things properly It's okay bothering the locations but we only have to move our phone here and there following the arrow to find a particular thing. After you find u will probably zoom to see a better vision but as soon as you get close the screen starts shaking and your arms start to ache. I tried to zoom to andromeda galaxy. My right hand that was holding the mobile was still and the left one was zooming yet the screen was shaking. That probably means that the app didn't want to let you see it. I say Do NOT download this

Review 6: Truly bad  use Sky View instead. Pointed toward a bright planet (Venus) on the western horizon but it couldn't find it. Also several other objects that my brother found with the Sky View app on his iPhone. Gave up and downloaded the Sky View app instead which worked great immediately. On Samsung Galaxy Note 4. It asked for location permission which I allowed then went into some stupid app overlays setting which is unnecessary so I exited and it told me location permission wasn't allowed. Set permission but still couldn't find things. Bad.

Review 7: Loved it but stopped working I don't know what happened. After about 2 times of perfect use (in which I absolutely loved it) it just kind of stopped working. It would lag and skip over things. The accuracy was gone. I calibrated it numerous different times and checked that my location was on. Even uninstalled it and reinstalled it 3 times still won't work. Said something one of the times that something wasn't permissible not sure what I went to quick and ended up skipping over it I wish I could figure out what happened cause I loved it

Review 8: I remember it being so much better Still neat  but issues. It won't find my location even after I grant the app location permission. I had to go in to the permission settings manually. No other app has this issue. Position of objects above the horizon was off  using both accelerometer and gyroscope. Every time I change orientation  I had to recalibrate my compass. Keeps giving me a message about screen overlays and sending me to a settings page with tons of apps with screen overlays. What am I supposed to do about that? Frustrating.

Review 9: Awesome app  gyro not good I loved this app! However  I noticed after recent updates (either app or Android system  not sure which) that the map is less accurate and very jumpy! I've used this app for awhile and loved it  but when I went to look for the recent meteor shower  it took me awhile to get it working  and it is still not steady and not very accurate. I am judging accuracy based on the moon's location  which is big and bright  but not write correct on the sky map! Please fix this  and I would give 5 stars!

com.google.android.stardroid,Positive,"Review 1: Overall  Sky Map is a great application. It is perfect for the beginner astronomer  as well as those looking to learn more about astronomy  and familiarize themselves with the solar system. It includes many convenient features such as the ability to enable and disable the appearance of stars  constellations  planets  and much more. The feature I enjoyed the most was the ability to “time travel.” I could easily enter a date and time  (past or future)  and view the solar system at that moment. This feature also allowed me to observe the changes in space that had occurred  or that would occur between the present and the time selected. Sky Map was able to accurately determine my location  and display celestial objects in relation to my position. An element that should be incorporated into this app is the ability for users to view information about any given celestial object they select. This would provide a more educational experience for those interested in furthering their knowledge about celestial objects  rather than just where they are located. In conclusion  this is an easy to operate  yet highly capable app that many astronomers  both new and experienced will enjoy.

Review 2: Motorola Defy +  Android 2.3. Works as advertised. Sky view follows phone screen orientation accurately  both in azimut and in elevation. 4 stars only due to comparison with SkEye  as I haven't found how Sky Map can show basic details for the celestial body at the screen center and how Sky Map can show celestial position of the screen center (SkEye can show this information). Allows to search a specific celestial body (but you need to remember the name as you have to type it; I could not find a list of celestial bodies  list that is available with SkEye) and shows on the screen an arrow allowing to orientate the screen towards the searched body. It is not always clear if the GPS position has locked correctly: it is necessary to use an other application to check that the GPS position is being acquired properly (SkEye shows when starting the GPS status with number of visible and used satellites and informs when a GPS position has been acquired properly). Small foot print (less than 0.5MB) and can be moved to SDCard. No adds that I could see. So far good enough for me although I prefer SkEye for the reasons described previously. Thanks to the developer.

Review 3: I love this app. I specifically looked for devices having compass while shopping. I compromised on other things to buy a device with compass. I just bought it last month and now they included gyroscope support (makes compass sensor obsolete) 😭 my bad now I'm stuck with a mediocre device EDIT: Oh! Thank you for letting me know. I don't have to regret anymore :D REPLY FROM DEV FOR MY PREVIOUS REVIEW: Not at all - it needs the compass too. The gyroscope only detects speed  you still need the compass to 'anchor' the device on North. Basically the compass and accelerometer still determine direction  and the gyro smooths out the jitters.

Review 4: New search update is sick! Love it! I love the new search update. You type any planet/star/satellite and it navigates you there. You have no idea how much I wanted something like that because earlier I used to put my phone on every direction in order to search for something I can't find. But this made my job a cakewalk. Thanks for the update. Just one problem  sometimes its not very accurate. Which is cool I guess  since its outer space we are talking about. But still I wish it were 100% accurate. Its still an amazing app. I love space

Review 5: Still one of the good ones! I had this app before and removed from a previous phone for space. Just never had installed on my (then) newer phone. (Using Note 3) installed tonight  downloaded quickly and was ready to calibrate. Calibration took a couple of trys and did end up using the figure 8 method to do so. (Explained in app) Went from low accuracy straight to high. Everything lined up perfectly. Such a fun app that's also very functional. Now I'm eager to see if it will work just as well on my new(er) phone upgrade.. Note 5.

Review 6: Thank you Sky map devs :) When I first opened ver 1.9.2 the app seemed to be broken. It always showed me the nadir centered in the screen. I found that gyro is on by default but locating objects wasn't working if phones' auto rotate is OFF. When auto rotate is ON  the locating works but it gives me very shaky results. However  when I followed the advice of the sky map devs and disabled the gyro in the app options I found that locating objects works well and gives me smooth result regardless of the phones' auto rotate setting.

Review 7: Awesome app I retract my earlier review i learned how to fix it..i learned that i needed to keep my location (gps) on during use of this app and now its very accurate.sorry about the bad review it was my own mistake.this is an awesome app and i highly recomend it if u r interested in the amazingly vast and awesome universe.i know i am and i hope u do too.remember thats where we came from. Somewhere deep out there. Created by an amazing being with an imagination that knows no bounds. Thank u god for including me.. luv u

Review 8: INCREDIBLE I just downloaded this app.. Curious about the sky  you see i went out to my car to get my purse.. I was about to walk right back in but something told me to look up  which i hardly ever do due to the annoying street light's  office light's  and the fuel stations light's.. There are entirely too many. So not a city gurl.. anyway i did a search.. And found this app and my world ws made new.. The stars i was looking at and trying to make out what they were were not stars at all.. But planets I so pleased. TY

Review 9: Amazing results I seldom go out of my way to rate apps  but this one is truly outstanding! The map is accurate and as long as the phone location is turned on will reflect everything celestial there is to see in the sky. It even shows the correct location and phase of the moon. If it seems off and you use the android battery saver  make sure location is on (battery saver turns it off). You might have to restart the app after making that correction  but after you do  the map will be dead on. Absolutely love this app!

Review 10: I've been using this app for a while just because I love to look at the stars and track my favorite constellation  Cassiopeia. I've tried other apps before  and this is still the easiest to use. But when I re-install the app  I found Cassiopeia shown in a different formation than the famous W formation. With that one mistake  I now doubt the accuracy of other info in the app too. Please fix it =( *Update: Thanks for the reply  explanation  and update! This is definitely a great app for a beginner star enthusiast :D",6805,Sky Map is perfect for the beginner astronomer as well as those looking to learn more about astronomy and familiarize themselves with the solar system.

com.google.zxing.client.android,Negative,"Review 1: It used to work fine  but now every time I scan a QR code it will display the link of the page the QR code points to and after I either go to the page and then come back to the app  or just close the link and return to the app I get a message that the camera has failed and that I may have to perform a system reboot to re-enable it. This not only prevents me from using this app again  but it also disables my phone's camera! I have to reboot my phone to get the camera to work again. FAIL! This never happened in the past. I don't recall the last time I used it  so I don't know how many updates have been published since that time to narrow where the issue first came up. Too bad... I liked this WHEN it worked. Will have to check out the competition's offerings.

Review 3: Didn't work It didn't work with me  but the then I always have trouble scanning barcodes on anything other than the one on the till  where I work. I don't know if it's just these app aren't designed for English barcodes  the box area is the wrong shape and size the fill up the area with the barcode but still have the whole of the code showing etc  or your expected to be able to hold your tablet perfectly still (no slight shakes ect) for several minutes  without putting it down moving one hand so you can tap your fingers in shear boredom.

Review 4: It's okay but... It only scans big items. And some of the big items  don't go through. I feel like i wasted a good 15 minutes waiting and trying out this new app. I wouldn't recommend this too anyone but... You know you can do what you please. I hope you can find a way to make this better. Scanner people. This isn't all that bad but  we need a lot more item scans. And you never know i may change your mind on this app. Well goodbye. Keep working on this app. It's pretty bad. Sorry... Just being honest

Review 5: Seriously??? A MANUAL FOCUS is it too much to ask ? Deactivated autofocus places the focus at infinity (because we all know that barcodes must be scanned from 5 meters from the scanner...) and the limited focus presents the same problems than normal autofocus ! Give us the CHOICE OF THE DISTANCE already!!! More than five years this app exists and since the beginning of android autofocus is only good to go back and forth when aiming at small objects and devs continue to rely on this faulty feature!

Review 6: The app can only read barcodes when the phone is oriented at landscape mode. If the phone is in the portrait mode  the reading screen remains in landscape mode and I'm unable to read the code (when at the settings menu  the screen follows the phone's orientation  the problem is just when at the scanning mode). I already tried to change the """"""""""""""""no automatic rotation"""""""""""""""" option  but the problem persists. Had the same issue with Moto X 2nd gen (now with Galaxy S7E).""""

Review 7: Poor Refused to scan both the Ikea barcodes I had lying around  crystal clear black on white. Tried to use in conjunction with excellent My Groceries app  but failed to recognise any of the Lidl product bar codes in my kitchen  so no use at all I'm afraid. It also struggles to focus (that was not the problem with the aforementioned)  preferring the carpet over the barcode; maybe that's my phone's fault? Seems no way to set portrait mode  so it's awkward to use.

Review 8: Permissions disappoint I wish I could opt out of sharing my entire contact list with this app!!! Some apps sell location and personal data to advertising companies etc. Some apps  like brightest flashlight free  masquerade as a useful thing  but their PRIMARY purpose is selling geodemographic data! Therefore all apps with respect for users should allow us to OPT OUT of sharing personal and location information!!! Stand up for your rights before its too late!

Review 9: Not what it used to be Unfortunately  this app has become frustratingly difficult to use. It randomly defaults to either portrait or landscape mode (regardless of settings) and whilst in portrait mode will not scan 1D barcodes. This is a pity as I used to like this app. I will keep watch for updates and bug fixes. I have given two stars (not one) in case these problems are device  OS version  root status dependent. HTC One M9; marshmallow/sense 7.0; rooted.

Review 10: Needs Internet connection. I downloaded this app as required by my Christmas gift organizer. Every time I tried to use the Barcode scanner  I received an error message stating I needed an Internet connection although I was connected. Frustrating! UPDATE: instead of offering any suggestions to fix my issue I received a curt reply that I wasn't reviewing their app  and to fix my review. Terrible customer service. Don't waste your time with this.",5314,The app can only read barcodes when the phone is oriented at landscape mode. Some apps sell location and personal data to advertising companies.

Although I have two bar code scanners & both of these work just great... have been using it for about an year now... your prompt responses to the posts was what forced me to install your s/w and I must admit the utility works like a charm. Those who have passion spends time in open source development & give it free to the world.. so do appreciate their efforts instead of cribbing... well  lets see what are your contributions.""""

Review 2: Hi there! I've been using this great app for several years and it always worked flawlessly. I just reinstalled it on a brand new moto x style but can't get it to work with some QR codes as it crashes systematically (I sent a bug report). The ones it crashes with (there may be others) as the ones generated by Amazon and Microsoft for their two-step verification. At least on my phone. I tried to alter the settings to no avail. I hope it will get resolved. Thanks Update. uninstalling and reinstalling the app solved the issue.

Review 3: Nice meme The best loadout is assault with offensive perk  the m1014 (laser  full choke  rds  stubby) 12g shorty sidearm  m26 dart or frag (frag for getting people to abandon their cover) v14 mini grenade (also for smoking people out of cover) and of course medic bag. Basically the m26 covers your longish range needs but mostly you're going to be up close and personal! The m1014 full choke has surprising mid-range effectiveness. Nobody will be able to touch you even if they attack you first! in range  they're dead.

Review 4: Over last 7 years installed and then removed many barcode & QR scanners on my smart phones. Some have worked better than others but this one is probably the Mother of all Scanner Apps as it has remained Open Source and spawned a whole generation of other similar apps. Both saving everyday people like me thousands and helping profit oriented developers make money. Over many years I have become confident this App does Not harvest or steal my data  unlike many other apps out there.

Review 5: This app works well with various devices I've used. It supports many different barcode formats + QR code spec. Primary Purpose: Reads a barcode via device camera & displays encoded data (barcode number/string or QR code URI). Free - No ads & respects privacy. Trusted - This is the default code scanner app used by Google Authenticator for setting up 2-Step Verification and secure login. Google prompts users to install this app when adding a key using QR code feature.

Review 6: Doesn't scan barcodes. I have tried using this to scan dozens of 1D barcodes and it does nothing except make me look foolish standing in one spot for five minutes with my phone in one hand and some bag or box of something else in the other hand like I'm going to perform laser surgery on it. I'm giving it 3 stars because it does a great job with QR codes. Call it a QR scanner only and get 5 stars...or add the ability to perform laser surgery with the app. Up to you.

Review 7: Great fun  not really useful You can scan the barcode of an item  then press a button to look for that item on the internet. It will then load Google showing you listings for that item  although you already knew that because the name of the item is written on the same box for which you got the barcode. Would really be useful if the program could add the barcode and the internet listing to a text file  so you can efficiently catalog products in your home.

Review 8: This app is simply perfect I needed to know what a barcode meant.In less than a minute I was able to download this app  scan the code and look up the code's meaning online. not only is this app small enough to download quickly it's also incredibly fast the app had actually scanned the code before I realised it. If anyone is looking for a barcode scanning app I simply can't recommend this one highly enough. top hole!

Review 9: Does what it's supposed to do ? ? but there's room for improvement. What I'd love to see is the recognition of even more mime types (e.g. the Google Authenticator protocol isn't recognised). Also reading QR-codes from a bitmap would be a great addition because sometimes people share those with you and obviously you cannot scan them using the camera when the screen is part of the same device :-) Thanks!

Review 10: No-nonsense  great app. Works on all of my devices. For me  this application helped in my old android phones where there weren't any updates or were low on internal memory. This would be redundant in the coming times for most manufactures are including barcode scanning capabilities in stock camera apps. Wouldn't be surprised to see ZXing Team working on a camera app themselves.

Review 2: Will only be Six Stars if 1) Why root? I think the same app with the same UI can be done using the internal VPN tunnel technique. 2) adding possibility of reading the contents of the packets. 3) decryption of the packet using SSL certificates. However  this app is the best so far in showing data flow of traffic and per packet analysis.

com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail,Negative,"Review 1: This is probably the most enjoyable game I've played on Android. It is not without its flaws though. It's still under development. It has been for years and in that time it really hasn't progressed much. There are quests you can't finish and roads you can't take with nothing to signify which ones except they don't work. The """"""""""""""""guardian"""""""""""""""" creatures blocking narrow paths quickly become tedious because they're on nearly every single screen. EVERY cave  no matter how big  eventually narrows multiple times to just big enough for two rats or bees or zombies to stand  unmoving  side by side so you have to fight both at once. It gets real old  real quick. Some rewards for boss fights are really  really bad  useless items. Drop rates for the rarest items are ridiculously low at .1% and even .01%. Respawn rates are completely random  meaning a creature blocking a path may respawn right in front of you before you can even move forward after killing it  sometimes more than once. And the story line is severely lacking for a game with so many years of development. In many quests you are forced to choose sides with zero information and the choice you make permanently effects trade and services available. If you're lucky you get some information AFTER you've chosen a side  but even then it's he said  she said every single time with no real explanation. It's all about the reward. You're choosing a side  not to further an exciting story  but as a cheap device to decide which reward you get  which people you can trade with or which services are available. Repeatedly. There is no thinking involved  no weighing of options. You either choose randomly or you look it up to see what you'll get. Horrible quest design. Absolutely the worst I've ever seen. A TON of quests in the really crappy areas you hate going through are """"""""""""""""back and forth"""""""""""""""" busy work. But somehow it's still really entertaining  at least for a week or two.""""

Review 2: Mixed feelings I've played this game for a long time; i have partecipated in the online community. I enjoyed Andor's Trail  but i have some issues with it. some pretty BIG issues. First  this (very nice  very well written RPG) requires you to grind .. a lot. And to be honest  that's not entirely bad - it's a mobile-phone RPG  so the grinding actually comes useful at times  when you have a moment of boredom during your day  waiting for the bus  at lunch  or whatever  just open it  grind a few mobs  and put it back in your pocket. But you will need to grind quite a lot to advance in the story. Second  while the game is very nice ... it's not finished. NOWHERE near finished. It will never be. There's not been a single update in a whole year and there was ONE update in the year before that. I've basically been playing it since early 2011 and i've seen a two updates  one very minor  since. And that's a real shame  since the story and writing are so good. But after playing it basically every day for two years straight i just couldn't take it anymore and deleted it. Android is just not a good platform to build a full bodied RPG. Sorry guys  but honestly i can't be asked to wait forever.

Review 3: Fun game with some serious flaws. Skills are almost completely useless. Item choice is almost irrelevant. And the drop rate of the rarest items is so low that by the time you've gone through the entire content of the game you will have killed 10% FEWER creatures than it would statistically take to farm just ONE legendary item. That is astronomically stupid. Who the hell wants to go through the entire game  then kill that many creatures again  plus another 10% besides  all in a small area of the map  the same creatures over and over again to get an item which  by that point  is useless because you already finished the game weeks ago? And then do it AGAIN for the next rare drop. Items that rare are useless. By the time you get them you no longer need them.

Review 4: good but a little frustrating: monsters move way too fast! Whether or not you attack or are attacked makes a big difference. Using arrow keys to move is nice  but doesn't allow diagonal. Tapping can make you dismiss the attack confirm message box and end up being attacked. I found this really frustrating. I'd much rather have things determined more by initiative modifiers etc  rather than tapping away. :-( Other than that (and the lack of sound) this game is actually pretty good. Stat's galore! But now I've got an attack chance of 105% and am still missing the rats pretty often... :-( Still needs work on the combat mechanics.

Review 5: Should be amazing but fails. They also have FAKE reviews posted. This could be something great but a lack of development makes it WORTHLESS. Judging by the forum this app has been dormant for at least 4 years. The game play is immediately repetitive. Seriously its all the same forest. Leveling up is FLAWED and skewed. I played for an hour to hit level 6. Yet on the skill menu which has 20+ skills listed i was unable to increase any of them. There is no base increase upon level up. Instead you get a single WEAK increase of one of your 4 core aspects.

Review 6: Ive seen people charge for worse This game is free. Really free  no ads popping up every 30 secs  no pay to win BS. Its awesome. A bit rough  but its still indev. Google Play is stuffed full of garbage """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""free"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" games where they seem fun at first but they are basically just ways to suck as much $ out of you as they can if you want to actually get anywhere. This game is not that. Ive seen devs charge $2-$5 for games that arent as nice as this one. Id happily donate a few $ to support its continued development.""""

Review 7: The experience loss though... Games good  plenty of dialog and large world.... But the combat is one sided... Against you. I played a sword and shield mostly defensive styled character but I find myself constantly missing and getting hit despite having high dodge and block... Oh... and that death penalty... That needs to be fixed badly... Giving a skill that lowers the penalty is not enough when your losing almost 1/6th if not more of your experience every time.... Even trash you push through to get to where you need to be could kill yo

Review 8: Definitely a grind-fest A good game  but I never progressed far enough to get into any storyline.I`d kill low-level monsters to get enough gold to get cooked meat at 89gp so I could survive long enough to finish quests  & leveling up (or trying to) in the meantime... Cant get even half-decent weapons or armor atm  lose too much XP when I die  & most animal drops are only worth 2Gp (glass gem & animal hair is worth the same  really?) Items do get better as you progress  but Ive been in same town/area for 4 (of our) days grinding :(

Review 9: It has potential I gave it a 3 even though the movement square by square annoys me enough for a 1. This game has a lot of potential just like many others that are similar emerging like this. But when your trying to get somewhere fast over and over again the one square movement drives you nuts and interest in the game drops. Then the uninstall. Also i don't have time to register in a forum every time I have an improvement idea. I'll leave this on my desktop for a lil while in hope some corrections for smoother performance is

Review 10: Very Promising Hours upon hours of gameplay available. Wish it was easier to hit creatures though. Even with 133% hit chance I feel like I miss a third of the time. Also  put more details in our quest lot so we aren't having to take our own notes to keep up with the 10ish quest we have going on at the same time. Fix those two things and this game will probably be a 5 start. Also  please add the option to choose who you want to hit when you are in battle with multiple creatures. May discontinue play due to these problems.",7900,'Andor's Trail' is probably the most enjoyable game I've played on Android. While the game is very nice ... it's not finished.

com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail,Positive,"Review 1: Awesome game!!!! Well written  engaging and unique stories. Many quests  not all require hack 'n' slash (which is realistic) and the story outcome truly depends upon the choices you make. The game is free because its an """"in our spare time"""" project  which is the real reason updates have been a long wait. But there ARE updates coming up  the next one is being tested now. One review reads  """"I wish there was a D-pad"""" obviously that guy didn't check his player options! Adding sound would take up memory that the dev team would rather use for more story elements  items  towns and quests. Sprites are all free license and the game is available in multiple languages. Some new players have gotten involved with development  so there will be original sprites in the future (I'm guessing... since at least 4 of the new people are artists). Plus the AT forum community is the best there is and quite helpful! Get it  keep it  and get into the forum to stay informed!

Review 2: I keep going back to this game  creating new characters  and trying out different character builds. Even though the game is not finished (it's being built by volunteers in their spare time... kudos to them!)  it lends itself well to playing around with the different options related to how you develop your character. Want to be a hulking tank of a brute  you can do it. A swashbuckling fop? This game has you covered. An axe wielding barbarian? No problem. A sneaky backstabbing thief? You can be that too! Basically this game really takes me back to the old school RPG days without having to commit time to a gaming day. I can pick it up and put it down when I need to. That's not something you get very often in today's RPG world.

Review 3: This truly is a great RPG game at it's core. Simple  yet difficult. It's D&D. Which is great. Although at times the Hit Chance seems to take a mind of it's own (89%? No I think there is a decimal point missing there...8.9 sounds more correct with my playthrough haha) The only gripe I have at the moment is that gold is really hard to come by. Loot is worth nothing and healing items are impossibly expensive. Would it be possible to add (Or maybe it's there and I can't find it?) a way to actually cook the meat that we find as loot? It's the only way I can see that I 'm going to be able to actually finish this quest. Monsters get far too strong far too fast and without money I can't get past it.

Review 4: Hey  Love it   thanks! keep up the great work. Is everything op and hard to fight for a reason  do you have to grind to get anywhere? Maybe I am missing something  idk  its pretty difficult. What do you suggest? Also when your player moves  the back ground moves instantaneous  giving it a sort of lagging look  even thought it isn't laggy  that way it moves it hard on the eye and makes it difficult to move and dodge dangerous creatures for me anyway. If that could be fixed It would give it a full 5 starts!!! Cuz other then that its a pretty cool game :)

Review 5: Continues a legacy of excellence While unfinished  this game continues a long line of excellent games I have played in this genre. Fans of classics such as Larn  Castle of the Winds  Nethack  and surprisingly  Fallout 1 and 2 will find familiar elements to those games and enjoy themselves immensely. There is a minor learning curve at the beginning  and quite a bit of grinding is needed  but this A+ game is a must have for any android user. Remembering that this game is still in the works is vital  but I recommend everyone to get this game!

Review 6: Great game  still in progress though... A really good RPG. I can't wait to see how it progresses. There's a lot of side quests  and the gameplay is really nice. You have to grind quite a bit  but it feels rewarding when you level up. The game is quite challenging. The main storyline isn't completed  there is no soundtrack (though that doesn't bother me)  and the assets need improvement (I saw the thief sprite and many others from Fire Emblem!). Maybe some more maps and locations  quests  and game lore. I'll try to help by making quests!

Review 8: Shadow be with you. Haha! Right now there's a curse on me(in the game of course). I need to get an irdegh poison gland to free me of the curse however I was told irdeghs were far to the east  but i can't because where there is supposed to be a continuation it does not let me pass. I would really appreciate it if you updated the game so I can continue on my journey without the curse  which has some pretty awesome bad stat damage. I would also like the update because I've been in this hard situation for months. Thank you very much

Review 9: Could use improvement This is actually my first time playing a classic style rpg and it is an unforgettable experience. I downloaded this three times before i actually decided to give it a try. The only things to make this game better than it already is is to add some music and touch tones  it gets kind of dead without some good music. Also  when is the maps all gonna be input? Or do you just have to complete certain tasks to get farther on like across the river west of loneford. I defeated the river troll. Overall good game.

Review 10: Fantastic Game Reminiscent of the open world Role Playing Games of our past  this game boasts tried and true mechanics and mathematically (though also heavily luck) based combat. The world is vast  though some areas are still currently under construction. The sprites are mostly from other games  Fire Emblem being one of them  but that can be overlooked by the smooth  intuitive gameplay. The quests are numerous  and the intrigue between different sociopolitical groups enthralling. I do have a few complaints  but it's free.",6296,"The game is free because its an """"in our spare time"""" project. Sprites are all free license and the game is available in multiple languages.

com.grarak.kerneladiutor,Negative,"Review 1: BEST OF ITS KIND However  for those not familiar with certain definitions/terms.. I think they would find this all very confusing. It's easy enough to root your device but then stumbling across this app without knowing what you're doing could easily destroy a device if someone doesn't use it correctly  especially if used on a tablet without a changeable/removable battery and you end up ruining your battery beyond repair by calibration etc. So a glossary of terms section in the settings  or even better an ? Icon next to each function explaining what it will affect if used would be ideal. I know a lot about these types of functions but some to me are even a little confusing and so need to be googled. Adding the ? info would definitely make it a 5 star app in my opinion.

Review 2: A5000 custom kernel I downgraded from lollipop to KitKat but then I had touch screen problem. I consulted XDA and they provided a custom kernel that fixed the touch lag problem but it has included DT2W AND SWIPE to wake feature but unfortunately I don't like this because it unlocks my phone inside my pocket. The thing is I can switch it off within this app but it simply doesn't work. Why is it like that? Thanks for thus easy to use app. 5 stars and even purchase it when this DT2W AND SWIPE TO WAKE is switched off permanently

Review 3: If you disable a cpu core  it will stop auto control it had before  meaning it will stay on or off constantly if you set it so. Before you mess with it  you could see it turning on or off randomly. Another bug is zram. It just cant be disabled by default when turning on the device. Not everybody wants it. I dont want to make additional read write operations on my internal memory as it wears the ssd pretty much. Until then  this app is on my BLACKLIST. Im pretty dissapointed. Had to restart my phone to fix cpu cores

Review 4: Nothing happens yet... ... Suggested as companion for 6.0 MM r16f squid2 kernel (Moto X Play). Problem is... no change is being applied on boot! I've been very conservative with Adiutor just trying vibration strength first (which didn't work at boot)  but suddenly I felt like thoroughly trying it and well... Just updated in hope Adiutor will finally become of some help but... either I'm doing something wrong or Adiutor is simply not designed for 6.0 M or Moto X Play. I'll search deeper. Meanwhile...

Review 5: Problem with: target_loads In the past version if I changed anything it all went OK. Now in this new version  the only thing that doesn't work is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""target_loads"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in my interactige governor settings.

But it doesn't  because you're a pathetic person who can't put effort into technology. Every time I set something  it reverts back to the way the app FEELS like it wants to be. IF I CANT FUCKING SET MY OWN SETTINGS  THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T DESERVE A GOOD REVIEW FROM ME. Fuck you.

Review 9: Feature full and nice interface including an essential black one. Used it more and was happy to donate. Menu button on phone should open the menu instead of doing nothing. Fixes bugs asap as reply says. Edit: Apparently monetizing a previously free app now  and stuffing it with ads. Also despite my donation (when it was a donation and not a purchase) it claims I pirated it and gives me ads anyway. Would not have donated if I knew the dev would do this...

Review 10: Works for the most part Having trouble with my sheidl tablet. For some reason  whenever I enable """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""apply on boot"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with the selinux script on my shield tablet k1  the setting reverts as soon as I leave the menu  and the setting doesn't get applied on boot. A fix would be much appreciated  because I use viper4android and it's a pain to go into the scripts menu and set selinux to permissive on every boot.""""",5235,The app is easy enough to root your device but then stumbling across this app without knowing what you're doing could easily destroy a device if someone doesn't use it correctly. The app looked and felt awesome before this new terrible user interface design. New UI/UX is one of the worst. There is so much space wasted.
com.grarak.kerneladiutor,Positive,"Review 1: What can I say  Dev's a genius! Great  does it all but one tiny gripe as I am OCD  after I set my profile - why does it have to tell me Every single time in the notifications it applied changes on reboot  I get it to show the first time  but every time nor do I need the icon up in my top left bumping out my ram """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""clock"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in favor of it.

Review 2: The tool is amazing  for who have root and custom kernel it is a must. Always reliable. How ever  the old design was more straight forward to use and more simplified. For me  in this kind of tool a more minimalist design as the old one work better. But besides that  it is perfect. EDIT to answer the dev: I find hard to put the exact words about what of the new UI feel off in comparison of the older UI. But i would say that everything take more screen space now (the buttons  the title banner of each tab)  the older squares on each section of a page made better to localize the settings to change. I think that it take much more space then before. So it make kind of harder to browse.

Review 5: [Update] Well done. Except bug. Anything else? Clapping my paws. Things greatly changed in the past several upgrades. Features become handy  UI got a overhauled update. As I said before  if you have big.Little struct CPU  go and get this. However  under interactive mode  big cores freq table editing is not functioning. Hope there's gonna be a fix. For the UI  I don't get people why complaining about it. Till I checked their accts  and found out that low-end users with low range phones are having great issues. (Maybe old one looks more professional?) Cheers!

Review 6: Great Excellent! Unluckily  there's no custom kernel for my device as it unpopular models and my kernel doesnt support for tuning governor and my stock kernel default set the cpu governor as """"""""""""""""hotplug"""""""""""""""".

If I try to set it to highest value for """"""""""""""""performance"""""""""""""""" or lowest value for """"""""""""""""power saving"""""""""""""""" but the values decrease itself in 5-7 minutes. Anyway  this is the best app among all other relevant apps those Ive tried!""""

Review 7: Using on my MI PAD tegra K1! Awesome Not every game or app using full frequency of cpu & GPU. because I felt that games are little bit lagging due to full force on cores. I just under lock my cpu frequency to 1.5 GHz and GPU to 396 MHz. and guess what the games are running smoothly as well as battery life increase. I am playing all games like asphalt 8  modern combat 5😃😃😃😃 on full graphics. just increase cache size  entropy values to max and low memory killer to light mode and it's a balance combination of performance & quality. no words 5/5😉😉😉😉😉

Review 8: Mind blown Whoa. That """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""custom controls"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" section is AWESOME! I use a great kernel  but it's got a lot of non-standard sysfs paths. I had a modified version of the old KA  because it beat the control app the kernel came with. But this new custom controls means no modifying paths and building from source again! Plus  a nice way to run scripts with UI controls. No need to say anything about the rest of the app  it was always by far the best  and is even better now. And yeah  the new UI is damned awesome.""""

Review 9: Best Overall ROM Management App And then some. It has features that tend to require multiple apps  and handles them boss-like. There is a donate app (the workers are worth their wages) it's free  fully featured  and can be installed on the device's internal system partition  which is an ideal option for most apps. It's actively in development and you can get the latest beta version by joining the app's official G+ community. It's not perfect  but it's almost there. I'd just like to see a few more features added. Still a 5 🌟 app.

Review 10: Super App. I made this app as my system app. I didn't find anymore other apps like it. Cause it gave me much benefit in my swap ram with low memory killer function... My phone cleaned ram memory at a very aggressive. And so I couldn't play hd game with swap ram perfectly. And it is only one app which stopped low memory killer with so little aggressive. And now I can play hd game with swap Ram perfectly and can use upto 350 MB swap. Before I couldn't use upto 150 mb swap ram.. Many many thanks to developers...........",6586,The app is a must have for any Android tinkerer with the itch to Tinker  over clock  etc. Permanently used on Samsung Tab2 10 with 4.2.2 dual core Android.

com.gulshansingh.hackerlivewallpaper,Negative,"Review 1: Couple of annoying things but still awesome On custom sentences and lines of text my biggest pet peeve twoards this app is the fact that in order for people to read it you have to type everything in reverse (od ot gniyonna steg yllaer ti)  it gets harder to read unlike Binary or Matrix  which is spaced out and leaves a letter in its space and produces the next one on the trail. Why not the same for any size sentences? This also makes it easy to loop over and start from the beginning so you can actually read it without the fade.

com.harleensahni.android.mbr,Negative,"Review 1: Does not work at all on my Note 3 The app appears to be very buggy. While setting it up Amazon MP3 player did not appear in the list of apps to offer. I would up going through the setup 10 or more times while trying to get it to work. Amazon MP3 appeared once out of all the times I was setting it up. That was the 5th or 6th attempt. It disappeared from the list after that never to return. More importantly the app does nothing when I connect to bluetooth in my car. Prior to install the app I would get a seemingly random music app starting when I entered my car. I got this app to try to work around this Android bug so I could choose which app  if any to launch. But the behavior has not changed. I still get a random music app starting up when I enter the car. I do not know what  if anything  the app is doing.

Review 2: No longer working on Lollipop Nexus 6 This used to work great for fixing the Android problem of not playing music when I get in my car and my radio gives a BT play AVRCP command. However  at this point it's as though this app isn't installed at all and my stock Nexus 6 almost never plays music when requested. I have to take my phone out of my pocket  unlock it  launch Poweramp and hit Play to get music.

Review 3: Auto adding I life this a lot  but one little feature would make it perfect. A switch to switch auto adding of updates apps of. What I mean is that every time a app is updated ?Media button? automatically recheck the box for that app. I don't want that because then the newly updated app messes with which app is supposed to get the input.

Review 4: Needs a fix Whenever I add or update an app  it always default checks itself for media play routing  which is annoying because I have it set to only route to Spotify  and that's it. I don't want to keep unchecking every random app I add or update  they should be default un-checked on the list. Please fix!!!

Review 5: I don't recommend this app Didn't work Music default. Galaxy s6 jetAudio pro is my default app but on Bluetooth the default Samsung player enables  hoped this would fix it but unfortunately it didn't.

Review 6: Unreliable with LG G4 Under the G4's Android 5.1  the default media player starts over half the time  instead of Media Button Router intercepting the Bluetooth play request.

Review 7: Doesn't do anything at all on my Nexus 5. No pop up  no routing to the ONLY selected app  nothing to indicate it's even installed beyond the config screen being available.

Review 8: Doesn't do anything. My car auto plays my Google play app everyone I start the engine or complete a phone call. I even set it to conservative. Simply doesn't work.

Review 9: Perfect This app used to work perfectly but has stopped working for some reason. It no longer appears when my car stereo connects to my phone. Disappointing.

com.harleensahni.android.mbr,Positive,"Review 1: Great App But Have One Suggestion This is a great app. It annoys me that whenever my phone pairs with my car  it automatically starts playing my music. Sometimes the songs that play are ones that I downloaded for my daughter and even she is embarrassed about them as well. This app lets you determine which apps should playback instead. My suggestion is as follows  and I know this can be accomplished with Tasker but I feel this is way easier to use for Joe Schmo. Please allow the user to designate which app should launch. For example  I use Serius XM to listen to Howard Stern during my drive. It would be awesome if I could get Sirius XM app to launch via Media Button Router. Unfortunately  the Sirius XM app is not recognized as a media playback app so I cannot designate it in the Media Button Router UI. If you allow the user to designate which app they wish to launch  that would be a great advantage for people using apps that are also not recognized as media playback apps. Again  great app. It is a must for anyone wanting full control on their phone.

Review 2: Excellent App - got it working in my motorcycle helmet! After a lot of research and phone calls to Google  I finally found the right utility app to get the job done. A+++ I use a Sena SMH10 Bluetooth headset in my motorcycle helmet  and no matter what I did  I could not get past the default Samsung S5 music player - until now. Install this program. Select Google Play Now in the list  as well as S-Voice. You need to say """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""open app play music"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to run Google Play  as opposed to simply saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Play Music"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as a command. Set Google as the default  and all works as expected. The other headset buttons allow me to pause  next  previous just like the standard music player does. Great little app  and I'd be happy to pay for this if it was not free. 5-stars  and many thanks to the developer!""""

Review 3: Great functionality! The buttons on my Bluetooth headphones (Jabra Revo) were useless with Spotify until I downloaded this app. However now everything works like a charm. I also love the feature where you can toggle through all your music players with the play/pause button on my headphones. Thoroughly grateful and massively recommend. One recommendation for the developer is to allow the user to reshuffle the order of the list of available music players  to reduce button clicks

Review 4: Great app  needs some help on Kit Kat My original comments below are still true  but since Kit Kat hit my phone  I can no longer pause audio using headset controls and this app. Not sure if it's KK or the LG G2  but when I saw another user posting about it here  I figured I'd chime in. There's only one media app I use headset buttons with. This app makes it possible to direct all input to the media app without worrying about what app has focus  etc

Review 5: Works well  mostly. I got a new lg g4 and my car's Bluetooth audio would autoplay the default media player  even taking over for the currently playing media player. It made it almost unusable. This app seems too have mostly fixed the problem. However  for some reason Amazon mp3 doesn't show up in the list of apps. This app still seems to prevent the default media player from taking over  so I'll take it.

Review 6: Slick. Works with Shuttle+ and Podcast Republic apps  iClever HB01 hands-free kit. Makes it dead easy to listen to music or podcasts while I'm driving  without having to fiddle with my phone. Tap the Play/Pause button  use Next to select the app I want  tap Play again  and my playlist resumes where I left off. Don't even have to take the phone out of my pocket.

Review 7: Cool Allows me to map the Bluetooth pause/play button to launch a voice assistant instead of music. I had to have two items in the selection list and set the default to launch my app  with just one item in the list commands are routed to the app instead of launching it.

Review 8: Great App This app is a fantastic contribution to the open source community. However would it be possible to allow user selected apps to be opened? I want to use a pressy/mi key dongle to open apps on my phone. I would love to be able to use an app I can trust.

com.hobbyone.HashDroid,Positive,"Review 1: Tiny  and awesome. I wanted an app that calculates multiple hash algorithms on files  and this one was so tiny in size that I didn't even hesitate to install it. Just something to keep in my Toolbox  very handy indeed! Suggested features: calculating multiple hashes (algorithms) in a single pass  that would make it faster to check both SHA and md5 I think? (your algorithms would need to be tweaked I guess?). Also: multiple files in a single directory. Printing a list of files with the hash of each one (like the Linux md5sum utility) is a great way to see duplicates  and to check if all files in a folder have been properly transmitted for example. You're doing amazing already  those are just suggested improvements. Stay awesome!

Review 2: The best of the genre in Play Store However  it would be nice if the app could: 1) Calculate the hash of files/folders sent from other apps (maybe as command line parameter); 2) Remember selected options. // v3.3: when changing from one page to other  the first one does not vanish and overlaps the next.

Review 3: No extra permissions! Honestly  it deserves five stars just for being the first app I've seen with no special permissions needed. It also does everything it says it does. I would love something that also converts between Hex  Base58/60/64  and Bitcoin's 'Poetry'.

com.ichi2.anki,Negative,"Review 1: I am completely lost as to why this app gets so many good reviews  because for me  it is AWFUL - at least as far as custom decks are concerned.

Review 2: Useful  but the Android and PC Desktop versions of this software are missing many of the useful editing features available to iPhone/Apple users. You can waste a lot of time watching tutorials  hoping that they will get around to mentioning the existence of Android or PC or showing the non-Apple/iPhone interfaces (spoiler: they don't). And you can waste a lot of time trying to find the missing features you saw in the tutorials  (spoiler: they are not there). Finally  you can search their manual and supporting documentation for some sort of acknowledgement that these features are missing form the Android/PC versions of the software  so you can allow yourself to stop searching in vain and go to bed  but this search will be fruitless too. So  if you want an intelligent program training you on flashcards using spaced repetition  and you don't mind that you can do only the most nominal of editing of the cards themselves  this one is for you. But don't expect greatness  or supporting materials for non Apple users.

Review 5: Disappointing I had high hopes for this app to learn Spanish. But extremely time-consuming and confusing to learn how to use. Terminology used is unclear  not user-friendly. Ex.: 'study' would be more clear  obvious and accurate than 'review'. Review means to see again. It implies the material has been seen before and is a more cursory exposure to the material. I also can't remember where various features are: must search endlessly. Too complicated to learn. Descriptions too technical nerdy.Optional pop-ups would help.

Review 6: Pause button maybe? I'm using this app in combination with the desktop version. It's really great  but sometimes I simply don't have time to review everything I should review that day and then it piles up way too much. Would it maybe be possible to introduce some kind of a pause button so that the cards that should be reviewed don't pile up? I realize it doesn't make much sense to keep it paused for a long time  so maybe the function could be limited to a couple of days. Like this it's just too demotivating :-/

Review 7: Fix Zooming of images.. no solution even after several updates.You may make it paid provided fix zooming issue. Humble request to team anki. Kindly fix zoomig .After update Zooming not working.I am only dependent on images but after update I cannot use anki. 1.When click + to zoom   size of the image goes back to normal. 2.Even manual zooming not working either. I have checked IT on three devices. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.please look into this issue. I can't study without anki.

Review 8: I have been experiencing a problem with the app. Anki is a great app for memorising. The problem I have encountered is that  if I haven't been using anki for days and then started reviewing the cards  the time periods on good and easy button behave as if I have been reviewing them regularly. It shows big times like 29 days  1.5 month etc  when clearly  I haven't been reviewing them so I need to review them more often than what the app is suggesting. What is the solution?

Review 9: When I synch the account of my laptop then open the same account on tab it show me different picture on the tab  so I go back to the laptop to see if anything went wrong but no everything is fine! Something is wrong with the synch on the tap I'm talking about a card which made of pictures as Q and picture as a answer! Seems like the picture code or name cross another picture code and name and end up showing me another picture from anther one of my accounts or desks!

Review 10: The app was one of my favourites but somehow it does not work anymore (It only shows the 'settings' tab and whenever I click 'back' it closes and I get a notification that Ankidroid doesn't work at the moment.) which puts me in alot of trouble with my upcoming exams next week for which I now have to write everything down somewhere else again. It would be incredibly helpful if this was fixed.Before this I would have given a five star rating.",6453,The app is far too over-complicated. It tries to own when and what I can study. It disappears my cards if it thinks I have studied them enough. The Android and PC versions of this software are missing many of the useful editing features available to iPhone/Apple users.
com.ichi2.anki,Positive,"Review 1: This is the excellent flash card so far that I have experienced. Previously I used Brainscape on iOS  but it lack of customization features comparing to Anky (and AnkiDroid). With this app  you are able to store and back up multimedia decks externally  and even share with others. That is above my expectations. I wish I know this app earlier. The second feature I like and use frequently is the playback  it makes much easy to review what have been learned. There is still room for improvements  for example  users can choose different algorithms/ways to select a card for studying/reviewing  randomly card selection is an option. The reason is that for big decks  too much repetition for some cards makes the learner tired and wastes time. That is a reason I dropped one star.

Review 2: Terrific app! Thanks to all who work on it. Two small requests: 1. The language I'm learning uses three fairly obscure characters: ƥ ƭ ƈ. These show up fine on the desktop version  but render as blank spaces or a ? on the app. These misrenders then get synced back onto the database. Is there a chance this could get fixed  or should I go ahead and find alternate characters to represent them? 2. One of the advantages of a mobile app flashcard system is that you can easily create audio flashcards in the field. The current app requires five touches to record audio (+  Add  paperclip  record audio  RECORD). It would be great to be able to do this in fewer steps  though I realize that might not be possible without overcrowding the interface.

Review 3: Great but has some limitations Not sure if it even still applies to this version  because I deleted some of my more useless media files long time ago  but it used to have some limitation on number of media files (something to do with either Android or some types of storage iirc  which only allows you about 40 000 files (not sure if this was the exact number) in one folder)  which could be easily fixed by Ankidroid creating additional media folders when you reach the maximum number of files per media folder. Apart from this  great app.

Review 5: A Memory Card Program After about 2 years of use I can remember about 3000 words of italian. This only requires about 20 mins every morning. The app works very well  I can confirm that. You need to create the cards using the (free open source) computer program  it is not possible to create the cards using the app. Card creation is the initial part of the learning process  and you end up with cards that you have created for your needs. This flexability is one of the great things about anki. Ability to sync cards is great too.

Review 6: Beastly! Thanks to this app  I no longer have to make my own reviews manually and cover the answer with my hand. I haven't failed a single exam  not that it's common or anything  but thanks to this I have no worries. I have given my account to my fellow friends from class  thanks to the syncing option  and we take turns making our reviews through this. I really wished I had found this app sooner it has really been a life changer and I love apps that do just that  change lives. Thanks a bunch for making this! :D

Review 7: Good. Need to fix some problem. Help!!! 1. Newly added collections are added directly into """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""default"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" deck. By no means it is retaining it's new named deck. 2. In the card browser menu  I wish there was an option to mark the cards quickly or in the easiest possible way and that selected cards can be shifted to the desired named deck directly instead of manually going into each card and then select edit option.....to change its deck. Please help solve these problems. Thank you.""""

Review 8: Best learning app ever made This and the original desktop version are the best tools anyone could ever need to learn almost anything. To get started it can be quite different I remember when I first used it it took quite some time to get my head round it. But I have been using for about 5 years now it has helped me finally learn French and to get me though my medical school exams. To everyone giving it a low rating you need to take the time to learn to use it  anything worth doing takes time to master.

Review 9: Mighty app This app is not only helpful  it's also addictive! I did have an issue: I removed media from deleted decks in Anki desktop  then synced to Ankiweb  then to Ankidroid. For some reason Ankidroid would restore those unlinked media files  so I had to delete all my decks  do an empty cross-sync and start over. Not a big deal being a useful and free app  but I would recommend to anyone with the same issue just to save time if the sync keeps mumping up. Huge thanks to the Dev Team!

Review 10: Invaluable language learning resources. Only thing that would make this better is if the automatic TTS option allowed for specifying what you want it to read. It basically wrecks cards in languages like Japanese because it reads Kanji out to you before you can confirm you know the reading  but i would still very much like to hear only the question side of the card once I've revealed the answer side (answers on the other hand  i don't need read  and it just reads everything right now)",5758,Anki is an excellent flash card system. The app is free and available on iOS and Android. Users can store and back up multimedia decks externally and share with others.

com.ihunda.android.binauralbeat,Negative,"Review 1: I will shortly uninstall this app. These are the issues: I don't like free apps  because developers feel free to include annoying notifications within the app. I'm repeatedly asked to donate. Well  I'd be happy to  if I thought that donating would make that notification (and the other little love notes) go away. I'm also not particularly happy that it runs at startup. I see no reason for it do so. I would be grateful if the developer would offer a paid version that gives more control to the user  fewer message popups and a less obtrusive push to like it on Google+ and Facebook. I'd be first in line to buy it under those conditions. For now  I've found a different app that will allow me the privilege of paying to keep the annoyances at bay.

Review 2: My best scary dream I listen to variant lucid dreams before I drink alcohol. Then I fell asleep and have a dream of my four classmates and I went to a forest for camping and my classmates and I went there riding a bus. There was a guy who wants to kill us with poison syringes  machete and chainsaw. I managed to survive from the serial killer and went home by running. The killer chased me for a while and stomped his feet on frustration. In the end  one of my classmates was still alive when I went home. Pls add more sounds about serial killer dreams

Review 3: SLEEP at last I work night shift and have trouble going to sleep at about 6-8am every morning. My flatmates don't know the meaning of quiet and are stomping around  slamming doors  yelling at the kids to be quiet! So I put on my headphones put on the deep sleep wave and I'm gone for 8 hrs. I also recommend the high activity(for a faster wake up)  learning wave  and the meditation waves. I used to use the lucid dreaming and astral projection waves but that got a bit worrisome. Beware if you start talking to dead relatives

Review 4: A good one  but... I used the Morphine pain killer and was a bit surprised to see a green color on the screen. Yes  we all know that green is the color of healing  but actually it stimulates the reproduction of all possible cells which bind our organism. That means the bad tumorous cells as well  in case we have cancer. That's why it is not a good color choice for that group of people. And who uses morphine more often than them? But leaving that aside  this is a great app!

Review 5: The only issue I have is a huge turn-off for me: the background noise. I have sensory issues  and that background noise grates at me. It wouldn't be an issue if it didn't turn itself back up every time the frequency changes. It's incredibly jarring  and I can't use this program anymore until the issue is fixed. Otherwise  it seems like a good program. I'd really like to use it further  so I hope you can fix this issue.

Review 6: Just want to try it. I just installed this app and I will try it soon. As I experienced suffering from unknown anxiety after listening the other binaural beats or biofeedback  I don't want it happens again. I will give other stars after trying it and it can mean taking the stars back. Binaural beats are effective to induce  but it also effective to inject what I refer as collateral effect.

Review 7: From skeptical to believer I've experimented with binaural beats for years and I believe I was to you to appreciate it or even concentrate on it. Now I use it for sleep and I go right out. Now some of them I still feel are nonsense  like the LSD preset. I have done tons of acid and this is nothing like it. Oh and don't try i-doser. Its a joke and waste of money...

Review 8: I got results. I have tried a few apps and binaural beats albums after some brief research and only this one worked. I never thought this would work but i got results. The sleep induction and lucid dreams worked for me. Pain relief did not. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I'm skeptical about side effects  yet so far i haven't experienced any.

Review 9: Problems There is a problem  rather glaring  that if fixed  would make this a perfect app. Not sure if this issue is unique to my phone  but I used the app in my previous phone as well. I only noticed the problem recently. I noticed that although the frequency is supposed to change and variate  it doesn't. It stays at the same frequency it started as.

Review 10: should have a warning in-app definitely dont use this if you have adhd or really any neurological disorders of any kind  because that puts you at a higher risk of seizures and its really not safe. the warning/disclaimer should probably be displayed upon opening the app  as its not very common for people to go through and read the details.",4662,Binaural beats are effective to induce  but it also effective to inject what I refer to as collateral effect.

com.ihunda.android.binauralbeat,Positive,"Review 1: Please Make Highest Mental Activity Longer Please Make Highest Mental Activity Longer. As someone with ADHD-Predominantly Inattentive  the ADHD preset is useless. Unlike those with Hyperactive ADHD  which Alpha waves actually calm and relax them. It's the complete opposite effect with Inattentive ADHD. Too much Alpha tends to make us sleepy  drowsy and unfocused. The Higher Beta  but especially Gamma waves help us the best. Especially when doing homework or studying. Too much beta makes me irritated after 30 minutes  but Gamma waves keeps me focused for hours. An hour would be ideal if possible. Something longer than 15 minutes because as soon as I'm completely focused  SILENCE and I have to replay it. The constant stopping after 15 minutes is a bummer. Thanks for this amazing app. Life Saving!

Review 2: Best night's sleep ever! I did not think this was going to work. For months I have had a screwed up sleep cycle  (have insomnia and once Im asleep I often wake up 3-5 times a night  resulting in feeling tired and crappy in the morning)and have taken drastic steps to correct this (removed blue light sources after 6pm  use flux and redshift and twilight on mac  droid and linux machines  changed lightbulbs to soft 2700K  etc). I kept an open mind and elected to install this app. (I used the """"Lucid dream-variant"""" settings  and adjusted it by turning off the background sounds.) I woke up this morning refreshed  and did not wake up once during the night! 5 Stars! Proof positive that Free and Open Source programs are literally a dream come true. :)

Review 3: Only Binaural Beats App That Works I have A.D.H.D. and even though I am on a stimulant I feel tired all the time. I have tried many Binaural Beats apps on both android and iOS that have """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""stimulating"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" tones but they all have been ineffective and nothing short of a placebo until I tried this one.

I play it on my way to work and am energized for hours.""""

Review 4: Best Sound Files!! Brain/Body Companion!! Tried the others  sound files were glitchy or had annoying nuances. **I've been using this for years  religiously. I use to have severe issues with getting my mind to relax (9 million miles an hour) to go to sleep. I also had major concentration problems (mind always wandering) with tediously boring tasks/projects. Great app  it works! You will really begin to notice a improvement in yourself after a few sessions. Presets are just right. A must have for your brain and body!! ••@dev - that was kind!!

Review 5: Wow After reading about the effectiveness of binaural beats for children in school (via the Aubry Marcus podcast) I thought I'd try the app. I used the sleep inducing beat (crashing on parents couch after a long road trip). Within 15 minutes I was having a pretty insane lucid dream. I had to force myself to wake up because that's not what I was going for at the moment. I returned to bed 5 minutes later (beats turned off) and literally jumped out of bed after 8 hours. Currently trying the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""caffeine"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" beat...""""

Review 6: A very big gem!!!! Being aware that something could work and actually experiencing that it does are concepts miles apart. I downloaded this app out of curiosity rather than any preconceived ideas  and when I saw pain relief and tried this out I couldn't have been more surprised to find that the treatment really works ! I have been in pain for a long time and I benefited from one treatment. So I have to recommend that anyone should try this app you have nothing to loose and like me everything to gain   many thanks to the dev!

Review 7: Immediately try this! So I was sceptical of this app. I'm no expert on Binaural beats or tones so I started off light with the sleep inducing track. I felt a wave of relaxation 5 mintutes through and I'm yawning. I didn't know that before the description of each track it tells you how long to use it to achieve the effect 1/3 of the way through my track and I feel tired and its only 10PM! I highy recommend that users try the soothing apps first before jumping towards the stimulating beats so that your mind can adjust to it. 👍

Review 8: Life saver The morphine pain relief setting literally stopped me from throwing myself in front of a semi I've been in the worst pain for the last week I no longer thought I could live through another 4 days till I got to my dentist until I turned on this app within 5 minutes the pain became manageable until it was gone.ive been fine haven't even take my vicodin (which didn't really help anyways) in days.tomorrow I get my tooth pulled and I now it won't bother me because this app really worked.thank you it truly saved

Review 9: It's decent I've used this same program on & off for about 3 1/2 years now. I've done my own research on Binaural Beats and brain synchronizations when I heard about this. The concept for this is without a doubt interesting. But since it's difficult for me to keep my mind from wondering  I have always had problems using this consistently. I will say that since I have known about this apps existence  I ALWAYS download this specific app because it has always remained reliable to an extent for me. Thanks developer(s).

Review 10: Multiple uses I've had this app for over a yeah & it's helped me in many different ways. I use it to focus on work that I'm not exactly thrilled to do with the studying feature. I use the sleep induction and sometimes the lucid dream when I want to be aware in my dreams. I've noticed this has had an EMDR like experience for me  and I've actually been able to process and uncover some of my suppressed issues. Use a trained professional for trauma folks! Just wanted to relay that it happened.

com.iskrembilen.quasseldroid,Negative,"Review 1: Great  but pretty buggy. Often after the app has been running for a while  channels seem to not be reliable. Especially if I use a client on the computer in between sessions. I was very confused when I opened one channel to find a completely different one. Sometimes  the list of people who are online are off too. I've once found someone logged in under the same nick 4 times (that's a bug). Its because it doesn't seem to always register when someone quits or parts.

Review 2: Could handle disconnects better This is a well made application in general  and works great when you have a solid connection. But iffy connections can be very frustrating when the screen goes back to login mid-sentence. Also  highlighting should never use the same color as a username.

Review 3: Could really use the promised push notifications - that should solve all battery and connection issues (so that one can stay pretty much disconnected until a highlight or something). Otherwise a stellar app  supports pretty much everything the other native clients do.

Review 4: Faster & nicer The new version compatible with Nougat looks awesome! It's also incredibly much faster on connection (I wish the Ubuntu client connected that quickly!). Really nice job on the update  thanks for updating it to work on Nougat too :)

It displays your podcasts in a list  after you've listened or if you don't care about certain episodes  just click on each and delete. Formerly I used iTunes. I could NEVER delete podcast episodes  even after I listened to them & deleted - many times they'd re-download. My acct literally has hundreds of episodes  I can hardly find what I want. This simple  clean interface is much easier to look at on a phone or tablet than mega complex iTunes.

Review 2: Great App Love it  used it for a number of years now and was the first thing to download when I upgraded my phone. Only issue is with a couple subscriptions  downloading them and the stopping won't download the rest correctly. The only solution is to erase the history for that subscription and start again  deleting the duplicates. Later additions to the feed seem to download correctly but some of my subscriptions missed that middle bunch for a while. This isn't the case for all subscriptions  most work fine.

Review 3: Great app overall! I love this app  but I recently moved the files for it from my phone to the external SD card of my Galaxy S3. Now the player doesn't remember any of my settings  including which podcasts to download. I'm lamenting having done that because I probably won't try to set things back up  which is more because of my laziness than any fault of the app.

Review 4: Even works with steering wheel controls on a Leaf Great bit of software - saves messing around with diddy little buttons. Although as it works with the controls on the wheel  even better - seamless integration with the Leaf's entertainment system (shows the name and subject on the display; pages through using the fast forward etc.) Nice work!

Review 5: Great app! Auto download whenever you choose  listen later without using up your data plan. Excellent way to preserve battery life as well  if you have unlimited data and don't care if you're streaming. You can also record notes and have them for later. Buttons are big and perfect for traffic while in car  and Bluetooth controls work as well.

Review 6: Best podcast app I've used. I've tried many apps and this is the easiest and most reliable app out there. Only complaint is when I'm listening to a podcast and go to download the new podcast it stops playing the current one so it can delete the ones I've already listened too. It should be able to keep playing and do that at the same time.

Review 7: Simple Very simple app to use. Only problem with simplicity is there's few options. No way to pick and choose specific podcast episodes you want to download and no way to change the order in which they are played. However if your looking for something simple to listen to automatically download daily or weekly podcasts this works well.

Review 8: Needs cloud sync Love this program but really needs a cloud sync feature to allow settings to be restored or transferred to new phone. Would be great to have a fav button so you can quickly tag to save a pod cast you want to keep. Even so it is still the simplest and easiest podcast app in the app store.

Review 9: Essential everyday tool I tried about 4 or 5 other podcast players before settling on Car Cast. It downloads reliably and its memory feature is excellent. Opening it is the first thing I do when I get in the car for my commute. I upgraded to the paid version.

com.javiersantos.mlmanager,Positive,"Review 1: Good app needs multiple app to one apk! Needs the ability to all user to pick multiple app in one apk then compress using 7z since 7z compresses the first file & any file the same is not saved but a link to first is made(HENCE ARCHIVE IS DRAMATICALLY SMALLER) so when extraction is done the unpacked folder is the same as original - Ability to link with appmonster etc so you can make a single apk with all your versions of the app saved as one file with the ability to choose which version to install.

Review 2: Great but few issues. Dark UI would be much appreciated for us amoled users. List load and refresh times are very slow for me and unfortunately when you rotate the device it attempts to refresh the list again which is painful. The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Delete all extracted APKs"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in settings needs a confirm popup - I just deleted everything with a finger slip.

Review 5: The only credible and professional APK extractor It is an excellent app indeed  helps if you need to backup an application (apk only) and also if a friend of yours needing an app during difficult times. It is also very polished  beautiful and easy to use. A con however is the long loading time when the app is launched when it is listing all the apps. Maybe caching would ease it down?

Review 6: So far... We have the pro version. Worth it. On our rooted phone  some apps weren't allowing me to extract the apps using normal apk extracting apps. This application helped me with that. So far  from what I've tested... Great. Amazing job Dev. Thanks for everything.

Review 7: Best Apk extractor in google playstore. I'm the regular user of ML Manager.Hello Dev  please add a feature like """"select all"""" or """"select all downloaded apps"""" under """"Extract Multiple APKs"""" option  that would be more easier.Thank you!!

Review 8: great it is a very useful app but really the name of app doesn't describe what it does i download it by coincidence from another app and extract apk i tough like extracting it and modifying the apk file anyway it is very useful app

com.jefftharris.passwdsafe,Negative,"Review 1: Few issues in the new version  but still great Personally I like the new colour scheme  but there is a missing permission in the install routine - the app doesn't ask for permission to access storage.

If the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""read only"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button is greyed out  you'll see errors when clicking on a file and choosing """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Open with"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" like: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /storage/emulated/0/mydirectory/myfile.psafe3: open failed: EACCES (Permission denied) but you can still own files by opening the app first""""

Review 5: Problem after upgrade It has been my favorite app till date but I may have to say bye to it. After the recent upgrade  it doesn't automatically show the psf3 file  where I have all my data and when I try to open the file ( after accessing the file via file manager ) it doesn't recognize my password. M in deep trouble. Please Help !!!!! """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Java.io.filenotfound exception """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Review 6: Not liking the need to open the specific password and then the drop down menu to copy to the clipboard. Also having a problem setting the default file to open. It doesn't recognize the psafe3 file that is in the folder that I designate. This only happens on my phone  HTC M8  not on my Nexus 7 2013. But  besides these small issues  it is still my go to password manager on all of my devices.

Review 7: This is a great implementation of PasswdSafe. Unfortunately  with version 6  I am unable to copy and paste my password because the menu option is missing. I saw a suggestion to use the alternate soft keyboard  which doesn't work on a Pixel C with an attached keyboard. Please provide the old menu option so I don't have to disconnect the keyboard to use my passwords.

Review 8: New Interface is several steps backward The new version is annoying: now I have to open a record &gt; menu&gt; copy password instead of long press &gt; menu &gt; copy Password or Username. Also  the old dark interface was nicer on the eyes and more discrete. The option to switch back to the old interface would be greatly appreciated.

Review 9: Never again  for my phone! This program is wonderful and useful on your computer. However  the app... not at all! The update that happened has override my existing database with nothing left. I lost all my entries that ive built for a long time. Complete waste of my time  i won't be using Password safe on my phone moving forward

Review 10: Used to be great... This app used to be perfect. But i cannot figure out how to use it anymore. It was so simple...

com.jefftharris.passwdsafe,Positive,"Review 1: on an android? I've used PasswordSafe (PWS) for several years on the PC. It works as advertised  and I'm very happy with it. However  I've never been able to use it successfully on my HTC ONE-X Android. If I bring up an app to log into  then bring up PWS  I have to copy the user id for the site  then go back to the app and paste it in  then go back to PWS  copy the pw  then go back to the app and paste it in. This is to much navigation on a mobile to make it worthwhile. I can rarely maintain context in the app in order to paste in the 2 fields. What is needed is some way to copy all credentials for a site without having to leave the site and go into PWS. I've not found any help on-line as to how to do this differently. 12/16/2014 -- after reading Jeff's reply  I did finally see how to change the input method. It is not very reliable on the HTC One  but that is certainly not a problem with PWS. When HTC allows it  the PWS input method is great  very easy to use. With that out of the way  I gotta go with 5 stars. Thx Jeff!!

Review 2: Simple and effective Have been looking around and tried about 8 others with various problems from messy interfaces  obtrusive ads and various restrictions. This simple but effective app does the job. In the notes it states to download separate sync app (I didn't notice this at first) and once this is done you can store your password file on the major cloud bases such as Dropbox. Would be great to have the companion app either integrated or a link in the main app to prompt new users to download if sync required (just for slow people like me) Also  an idea possibly for future development... have a sync file for app preference settings (such as default symbols  timeout etc) so that it only has to be set once and will follow the pattern across several devices (optional use incase anyone prefers different settings on each device). Just an extra but no biggy to do it manually. Great work  thanks for developing.

Review 3: 2017-1-2 NOT SOLVED:: today PasswordS are will not stay logged in to my password database when I switch between Chrome browser and pasesafe. I have used PasswordSafe on PC for years. Wonderful stuff. On my android cell phone ver 5.1.1 I found an issue. - open PasswordSafe and logon. - press the URL of the entry I need and the browser opens on that page. - switch (using the RECENT button on cell phone to switch) back to PasswordSafe and it has closed the database and I have to enter the master password again. - copy the username to clipboard - switch to browser and paste the username - switch back to PasswordSafe and it has closed the database and I have to enter the master password again. - copy the password to clipboard - switch to browser and paste the password . Changed to Keepass2Android. That works perfectly. Change Windows computer to Keepass. Now everything is OK.

Review 4: I love it but it doesn't save automatically I really like the simplicity and straightforward nature of this app. The fact that is possible to use cloud providers in such a way that the passwords are available to all devices is very nice. But when creating new entries or editing old ones it won't save on exit as it is common on the android UX. This makes an easy trap to fall  that I myself already fell multiple times. I would suggest to change the save button with a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""discard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and save on dismiss.""""

Review 5: Eej sure PasswdSafe is THE one and only safe way. Been using it on pc since it was still beta :) Using it on droid too of course but always forget to rate. SuperSafe password storage people  only need to remember one (master password) to enter the safe and simply use another one for wherever/whatever safe them in PasswdSafe and you're done)  the xtra app for syncing between droid and pc keeps both in sync (nice job dev  and thanks for porting to droid!!!). 10 wasn't allowed so I'll put 5 extra stars here ;) *****

Review 6: Fantastic app! Great app and I have been using it for years. I first got it when I had an iPhone and iPad and it was great and I have continued using it now that I have a Samsung phone and tablet. I like that I can transfer the password file between devices however that method is a bit clunky. I think a better option would be to sync files more easily over a local network without going over the Internet. I realize that the file is encrypted but i would like to keep it from going over the Internet at large.

Review 7: Good app! After getting the update and immediately missing the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""long press to copy usernames and passwords"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I came here to see if others were complaining. I was glad to see the suggestions to use the PWSafe keyboard  though. After trying it out  do I understand correctly that the intended workflow is to essentially never open the PWSafe app  since one can just access the app and associated records directly from the PWSafe keyboard  from within the browser? Thanks!""""

Review 8: Must have for every smart phone user I don't see how anyone could do without a password manager nowadays. And Bruce Schneier's password safe is the gold standard. I use a version of this on windows  Mac OS  and Android. This version by Jeff is fully compatible with versions on other platforms. Very nice user interface. The best feature is its integration with the Android system as an input method. Makes using a password manager on mobile so much easier. Love it.

Review 9: Happily used for years on PC. I'm so pleased this app has come to Android as I have used the PC version for many years and it has never failed me once. Now I can continuously access my password list wherever I am. I am a true lover of this program  and whilst I have tried other password storage programs  I found this one had the best layout for easy retrieval  the best fields  and a simple user interface. Many thanks for bringing this to the Android platform.

Review 10: Love it! I first started using this on my Linux machine  then Windows machine now on my Android phone. I suggest this program to all of my friends. Not only does it keep your passwords and other sensitive info safely encrypted  it also generates passwords for you which is also customisable. I could go on all day. Thank you very much for this!

Review 2: Edit: (Couldn't fit on last review) - It's not in apps  but when say I download an apk and it pops up showing permissions and allows me to click install or cancel.

Would definitely recommend  if not paid then the free version on fdroid  I just bought the app because I wanted to show support :) thanks for making this!

Review 2: Great App. As a f.lux user on Windows I always wanted an app as useful as it in Android  and after trying (and uninstalling) Twilight  I was losing hope. But Red Moon brought it back.

The freedom of control makes it perfect for different usage patterns.

Review 4: Just like trebuchet. You can install trebuchet using cyan apps but this is sometimes a little hit and miss as to whether it'll run.

Review 7: If you're looking for the best trebuchet  here it is! I have tried several launchers to simulate my experience I had with my earlier Oneplus One. After almost giving up  I stumbled upon this. And never had to try another. The best trebuchet based launcher  ever! Thanks dev team!

Review 8: Absolutely fabulous This is totally spot on! I've just switched from a Samsung S4 Mini running CM13 to a Sony X period and the launcher doesn't allow resizing of the homepage grid - this app allows me to retain identical functionality from my old device. Brilliant! Thank You.

Review 9: Pretty good  no nonsense Gives you the proper (cyanogen) Android experience  but I desperately yearn for the ability to crop widgets that bug out with too much padding. Also the ability to swipe down on any part of the screen to bring down the top drawer would be amazing.

com.knirirr.beecount,Negative,"Review 1: I'm doing a pattern where I need to repeat it 20 times. No clear instructions on how to do this.

com.knirirr.beecount,Positive,"Review 1: Almost perfect I love this app  and the fact that you can add multiple counters per project and have them reset is fantastic. The main reason why I didn't rate it a 5 is because there's no option (as far as I can tell) for reordering. I have a project way down at the bottom that I'm still actively working on  and I have to scroll past a bunch of others that I'm not working on anymore but don't want to delete in case I want to use them again. Also  a widget or compatibility with smart watches would be fantastic.

Review 2: Absolutely fantastic I have been knitting for forty years using pen and paper to keep track of rows. I have tried a few row counters that sent me back to pen and paper  then I found Bee Count. I have to say that this application is absolutely fantastic. It allows you to count the total row count and a repeating pattern count. You can make notes and set alarms when the row count target is reached. You can program multiple projects and importantly when you close the app it automatically saves your progress.

Review 3: Neat & handy app I'm a novice knitter  but past expert with computers and programming. This app shows a lot of thought  has many useful features for knitters of any level. The ONLY reason I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is minor (but still important to me). When actually actively working a project  I wish there was an option for a larger display/button area. I do not wear my glasses for most close work  like knitting  but that means I have difficulty reading the count or hitting the increment button.

Review 4: I do not know how I lived without this app! I always have multiple projects at once  so this is super handy to have all the counts on one app. The auto save makes me very happy. My only feedback is to have more background image defaults to choose from  say a lighter and a darker yarn background. (I am too lazy to find a background that would look good for a custom).

Review 5: Perfect and simple! The fact that you can add as many counts to a project  and alarms to a count  as you need is amazing! Also any background you like? Yay! Only thing is I wish I could change the font colour to something other than white so I could use a light background. Otherwise perfect! Exactly what I needed! Thank you!

Review 6: This. Is. Amazing. Every knitter/crocheter needs this! This keeps track of even complex projects! No more counting rows praying you did it correct. Being able to have every project documented and counted here is exactly what I needed. I can pickup everything exactly where I left off quickly. Thank you!

Review 7: The best knitting counter ever! I have tried several other counting apps  but this is definitely the best- absolutely fantastic! Simple but very well thought through  adaptable to almost everything- I copy&paste my patterns into the notes section and have everything I need in one place - genius!

Review 8: Adore it I absolutely adore this app. It's intuitive and has all kinds of helpful functionality (duplicating projects is such a time-saver!). The only improvement I would suggest is to have a way to mark projects as done and keep them in a separate list  to prevent cluttering.

Review 9: Works great! Love the fact that I can essentially write a pattern in it  with space to note cast on numbers  yarn type and gauge  stuff like that. Looks like the sound issue was fixed on one of the updates  so I am happily collecting Mario coins as I count rows.

Review 10: Best Row Counter App! I rarely review apps but I was so happy about this one that I had to. I struggled to find an app that would count my total rows AND keep track of where I was in the pattern due to repeats  but this app takes care of that with ease. Love it!",3741,Bee Count allows you to count the total row count and a repeating pattern count. You can make notes and set alarms when the row count target is reached.

com.koushikdutta.superuser,Negative,"Review 1: Gotta give it a low rating. I've used superuser in the past  but prefer superSU for various reasons now. I recently installed a rom that came with superuser included. Tried logging into snapchat  and I was getting an error that the login failed. I know that's something that can happen with root  that's not why I'm giving this app a low rating. I'm giving it a low rating because there is no option in the settings to perform a full unroot. That's kind of a must  even if it's just for diagnostic purposes. Unfinished app  after so many years of being out.

Review 2: There are no choices other than cancel and install and that scared me because it rebooted and was going update the system. Luckily I selected just reboot but still had no idea what it was going to do. Doesnt seem to promt me for su rights. So I guess the binary is not updated and there is no way to do it.

Review 3: I dose not even download Last time I had it it never worked. I tried everything and I even looked up how to use it and it still did not work. Now it will not even download and it is getting on my nerves. I have tried 20 different root APS on my phone and none of them worked. I watched a guy on YouTube with the same phone as my phone the  droid maxx  and it worked for him and not me. I did every thing he did and now I just give up on rooting my phone until someone tells me how to root my phone and for the root to work.

Review 6: No  I don't hate it. I don't even know nothing about this shit! Please  someone tell me why some sites say SuperUser is better than Rooting while others say you need both. I am not an idiot. My I.Q. is 142+ (testers unsure how high it really is) just like a lot of you guys and gals. I rooted my Hipstreet Pulse with KingRoot ( no P.C. as mine needs a new UEFI BIOS chip). It checked out as rooted but I restarted this tablet and the Root was gone. I am sorry to the developer but I am at my wit's end.

Review 7: Eh  a buggy superuser app! No  thanks I do respect the open source root idea. This supposedly better than cf's su app  but... The implementations are somewhat half-baked. Eg. DrawOnTop is fullscreen  and doesnt respect user theme. Mode change in tablet mode is inconsistent. Grant timeout is mandatory instead of instant ok. And alot more.. I don't feel comfortable using this  even I forced myself more than 10x on different devices. In the end I just fallback to cf's SuperSU.

Review 2: Great app! Truly the best companion app to the best torrent client. This app makes it so easy to add torrents to my server while I'm at hone or away from home. I wish you guys would add a button to open torrents from a location while still keeping the option of entering URL. Integration doesn't work well on my phone for some reason that button would help.

Review 3: Solid app Other clients don't tend to support qbittorrent to the point some won't have label support. This app works well and is simple to set up. I also like that there's a dark theme. Only thing stopping this from being a 5 star review is a lack of notification settings  e.g. Notification on torrent added  completed  ratio limit hit/pause.

Review 4: Awesome app but ... Good option is to add local and remote server options  so it switch to local profile when at home wireless and switch to remote profile when not at home. I know we can make profiles and switch between but then we will lose notifications  and should always switch profiles and ... transdrone has the same amazing option.

Review 5: Exactly what I was looking for It's a great app  and is exactly what I'm looking for. Minor problem I have is that it doesn't read labels already set on the client. Also  when setting labels it'd be nice to choose from a drop down box of previously added labels. Just like how the web ui works.

All my phone settings are set to show notification therefore this app broke my phone so I had to RESET it! Now my notifications show and I'll happly live without my screen turning when I get a notification! My phone is a Samsung j5 2016 btw.

Review 2: Great app  but not very compatible with the new S7 security policies. So it won't probably work very well on any Samsung device with Android 6.0. This is the issue. I use my fingerprint to unlock the phone. If the screen comes on because of this app  next time I want to unlock the phone it says that because of security policies to protect my fingerprint I have to use the PIN number :( Developer  not sure if there's any way to fix this  but if you google it you'll see that it's not only your great app.

Review 3: Great but needs improvement On Samsung S7 running the Android 6.0 the app has a conflict with the security policies. I am unable to unlock the phone with the fingerprint if this app turned on the screen and the timeout has expired thus turning the screen back off after the notification. Please try solving this issue because it is starting to get annoying.

Review 4: This app has messed up all my notification sounds. For some reason Twitter no longer makes a notification sound when a tweet comes through from someone I'm following. The notification comes up but nothing else. I've deleted the app and the issue still persists... Very bad app!!!

Review 5: Thanks Was frustrated that my screen wasn't lighting up for notifications after upgrading from S5 to S7. This app works decently but now I'm sporadically having to enter my pin instead of using my fingerprint and also the screen turns on occasionally without a notification.

Review 6: It used to work great and turn the screen on when I connected my phone via bluetooth to my car launcher but since the OS on my phone upgraded to Android 7.0 I can't get it to work any longer. My car launcher app is not showing up on the enable apps page

Review 7: Great idea  but poor execution and buggy! BEWARE: Due to a bug  this app is unusable on the S7  as it basically disables fingerprint scanner and forces the use of PIN every time you unlock the phone! When this bug is fixed  I will update my review.

Review 3: Perfect! I got an Android phone after using my iPod for years. One thing I hated off the bat was that my screen didn't turn on when I got a message like it did on the iPod. It's a great feature when you're in the middle of something and can just look down when you get a message. After getting frustrated with the lack of an obvious feature that should be in the menu of my phone  I looked it up and sure enough I found this app. It does EXACTLY what I want. It's brilliant. Tons of features and it simply works.

Review 4: Simple. Works. When my phone is on silent I still like to be able to see when I get a message or email. Ever since the android update about a year ago I think kit Kat 4.4.2 or something  this had been disabled. Now I don't need to have the sounds on our vibrate mode in for the screen to light up. No more missed calls or texts that I don't get notified about except by a stupid LED. This ago is simple and solves an actual problem. Thank you.

Review 8: It works!!!! Mine is Galaxy A8 on Marshmallow.. But if only the screen turned more softly  it would be perfect. It does turn the screen on but the way it turns on just so suddenly and that way makes it not elegant. I mean  I want the screen to turn on like an iPhone turns the screen on when it receives notifications  smoothly and elegantly.

I am appalled by some of the reviewers here  rating this great app poorly because of their own ignorance and stupidity.

The app not being able to show charging current only is because of a limitation in the Maxim DS2784 """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""fuel gauge"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" IC used by Samsung in the N10. It's not because of CurrentWidget and it's nothing that can be done software-wise. And if CurrentWidget is not showing what you would like it to show  start by contacting the developer  don't write bullshit in the review section.""""

Review 2: Useless misleading data on Galaxy Note 2 The mA value displayed by this app is meaningless  it displays the reference value not the actual charging value. Imagine your car speedometer would always display the maximum speed your car can travel at  but not the actual speed right now. How useless! The app displays the charging amps as 1698mA  but thats the reference charging value  not the actual. For days I've been trying to debug a battery charging problem using this app  and was totally misled by this number that it kept displaying. This made me believe that my stock charger (2A output) was working as expected  so I was trying to figure out a problem with my phone instead. I finally got suspicious when I connected a 700mA charger to my phone and this app still reported charging current of 1698. Finally I got my hands on another app """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Galaxy charging current"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which is perhaps showing accurate data.""""

Review 3: Strage issue started today on Nexus 5 This widget has been working great for the last two weeks  but today it's behaving strangely. It's giving me 0-200mAh while charging by USB  and 400-600mAh when unplugged. It should be the opposite...... This just started today  and I haven't changed anything. Very confused. Also the DashClock extension doesn't update automatically as far as I can tell  so it's kind of useless in that sense. Giving 4 stars based on accurate past performance but the widget but no auto-update on the DashClock extension  but I hope this new issue gets cleared up soon.

Review 4: Doesn't work - please update your app to reflect this While the author says in his description that the widget doesn't work with Motorola and Samsung  yet according to the Google Play store it is compatible with my device. I installed it  and it shows  always  1 mA charging  or 0 mA discharging. Great idea  but it's not compatible with my phone (Samsung Note 3) so please update your information/programming so it doesn't show up as being compatible with my phone. 1 Star for the idea  which is good  + 1 Star as the minimum you can get = 2 stars. Thx.

Review 5: Yet another battery app that always reports the current as a positive value. The problem is that it is common for a device to be discharging when connected to a low power adapter (or cheap cable) because the device is using more current than is being provided. Under those conditions CurrentWidget reports a charging current when it is in fact a discharging current. So far the only app I've found that gets it right is GSAM. Unfortunately  the GSAM widget updates very slowly.

Review 6: Does NOT work on some devices: Why? This widget is simply excellent and it's the only one I could find to actually record a log of the current  but the log feature simply does not work on some devices like the Galaxy Note 4 and LG G3. Does that have something to do with folder permissions? Tried changing that to 777  but the app would still not record the log. Can the developer tell us why is that happening and is it possible to fix it somehow? Thanks!

Review 7: Does not work as expected on Samsung i9305 and Moto G XT1033 NOTIFICATION PANEL: Totally failed to read any data on the Moto G. No data shown On the Samsung i9305  everything was blank. not even the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""no data"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" text on the Moto G WIDGET: very diffcult to configure. placed widget onto homescreen  config page pops up. Am I suppose to press the home button or back button to set the widget? no widget set on homescreen""""

Review 8: Didn't show up as a widget(at first)  can not show current Lenovo Ideatab A-3000: I needed to uninstall and re-install to get the widget into a list of addable items. Shows volts  battery status but no amps. Did not help to sort out which of my cables have too much resistance when charging then. Sony XPeria Go: On my Sony ST27i works okay(It seems I can not write separate reviews for 2 devices  that would be atleast 3 stars for Sony).

Review 9: No data  no data  no data Not worth the time. Downloaded to see my cable charge current. Tried on my phone and my nexus 7 gen2 model. Added to taskbar as suggested but never works. keeps saying no data. This is a simple app that just measures charge and it shouldn't require extra setup after downloading. Do yourself a favor and just download BATTERY MONITOR WIDGET and it works with no additional setup and smooth installation.

Review 10: Good product If you're a Samsung or Motorola user and are having problems  don't rate this app. If you can't read the developer's warning and manage to complain anyway  then you probably won't be able to function in life. You might as well tie two cans together and find a big cardboard box to live in. This developer has been around for a long time; I'm sure he's developed some thick skin to abide stupid people by now.",5904,Current widget works great on supported devices.

com.manor.currentwidget,Positive,"Review 1: Good Basic Functionallity - Moto X 2014 Shows correct current on my Moto X 2nd gen without using up alot of resources. I like that I can customize the text size and information displayed on the widget and force it to update the data by tapping the widget. The mA current displayed on the widget is positive both when charging and discharging  but the log file shows a negative value when discharging and positive when charging. This is not really an issue. I used GSam battery monitor before  but felt it was too bloated for what I need. CurrentWidget is just what I'm looking for.

Review 2: Great tool for comparing chargers  USB cable  & apps to see where your power is going to. Crashing my tablet and causing a restart when trying to graph 765000 log entries. It that gets fixed  it'll be a solid 5-star app! I've found Micro-USB chargers ranging from 80-1400 milli-amps (not all were designed for my tablet  but what the hell...). If you use micro-USB chargers (with detachable cables)   use the shortest cable possible  as I've seen that account for a 4x difference in milli-amp charging current (10 foot cable verses a 3 inch cable).

Review 3: Decent app with room for improvement. Hi devs  would just like to thank you for the brilliant work on the app. However  two things that could perhaps be improved on - 1. positive and negative values for the charge so that it's clear if your phone is currently charging or discharging. 2. perhaps the app could detect what phone you are and automatically input the arithmetic operation function? Also  if you do see this  can I just check that for the HTC One (M7)  the arithmetic operation to use is - divide by 1 000? Thanks a lot devs!

Review 4: Works well  one usability issue I nearly dumped it as useless  because the reading did not change sign when going from discharging to charging. Then I discovered it changes the colour of the lightning icon instead - not what an engineer like me would expect. Now I know that I'm happy  and can find the optimum position on my various wireless chargers. I am marking it down one star because of that. Even changing the colour of the numbers would be better; Red for discharging and green for charging. Nexus 4  Kit Kat.

Review 5: Love it! I've loved this app  and used it on most of my phones for a great indication of how fast my battery is draining or charging. Sadly  as I just switched to a Note 4  I must regretfully leave this behind as Samsung does not provide a way for this app to read what it needs. I can't take away stars for the app not doing what it cannot (and clearly warns me about)  though  so I'll rate it based on recent past experience with it instead.

Review 6: Exactly what I was looking for Helped me find out why my phone took too long to charge. (I was using the wrong charger which was just an USB2.0 one which delivered 4 times less current that what should be delivered). I also like the 'Top processes' feature which displays a list of processes ordered based on their average current consumption. This is much more detailed than the battery consumption graph that comes built into android.

Review 7: Great app to compare USB chargers  cables Thanks to CurrentWidget I was able to identify low-mA (slow-charging) chargers and cables. The real-measured differences were up to 3x in my case across 1A-2.1A chargers. Feature request: It would be awesome if the app could use the battery % full information and current intake power and estimate+visualize the time needed to get to a fully charged status.

Review 8: Fixed Downloads but hangs on install every time. If I kill Play Store it says it """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""successfully updated Current Widget"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but it's not in my widget list or app drawer. Nexus 5.

com.mantz_it.rfanalyzer,Negative,"Review 1: Squelch is non-existent in this app. The developer claims it exists but it is impossible to set up. No matter how I adjust the gain I always hear the RF noise in between the transmissions. This app will make me deaf. The only way to eliminate the noise is to manually move the dB slider up and down which very impractical and annoying. Every free PC SDR software has perfectly working squelch. Why this one doesn't? Could be a great app but luck of squelch makes it unusable. I would expect this to be fixed.

Review 2: The bandwidth seemed to be limited to maximum 2 MHz or so. I tried to increase the bandwidth but not possible. I purchased this is because one of the pictures in the advertisement showed the 2.4GHz band with around 10MHz or more bandwidth. Is it not possible to increase the bandwidth? If not  it is just the same performance as other free APPs.

Review 3: A God send! Awful interference problem with my 868MHz central heating system. 20min with this app and an rtlsdr dongle tracked the problem to an old controller with a near flat battery transmitting a continuous unmodulated carrier.

Review 2: Works Great App works well with rtl-sdr usb dongle except that it has a much more restricted freq range than a competitors app with the same dongle. Possibly a user error. Ie can not tune below 24Mhz. Get out of range error. Hoping this is user error as the support and upgrade path from this dev appears to be much better than competitors app. UPDATE: After response from Dev. it appears that the app is correct the tuner in my dongle has a24MHz lower limit  The competitors app appears to tune much lower ( doesn't throw error and has signals) but it is not actually tuning lower. After purchase support for this app is superb. Can't wait for future updates. Thank You

Review 3: For €0.79 this app is 10x less expensive than sdr touch and for that reason I gave it four stars. There are some improvements needed such as setting squelch and bandwidth could be easier  recording audio as well as the entire band  there is a high-pitched tone when using wide band fm  a way that makes it easier to fine tune and stability improvements. This app works pretty well on my device (OnePlus 2) but it does crash every now and then (when changing between portrait and landscape for example). I think this app is great for the price and does pretty much everything I need but I would like to see these improvements.

Review 4: Awesome work - thanks for open sourcing! So happy to discover this project. Thank you so much for the first GPL open source Android sdr spectrum explorer I've seen. Very exciting. It's also great that you've made it easy to put a $ in the tip jar via the app store. I'm really jazzed about RF Explorer! Keep up the great work! Other features it would be wonderful to see in future versions (these would be icing on the cake!): - DC offset correction - Audio gain control - (maybe even audio spectrum display?)

Review 5: Definitely worth $0.99 Only $0.99! Since the developer is quickly listening to user feedback - this app is probably going to be better than SDR Touch very soon! I have two wishes - Material Design  and remove the screen orientation settings to use Android's settings. Update: one of those wishes has already come true! The logo and name of the app is missing from the top right corner  though.

Review 6: Additional info Used it w/RTL-SDR (R820T) on my phone (Moto G) also and it works great there too. I already had FM on this phone and now have NWS  taxis  Aviation  Marine  etc. Hopefully scanner update soon. Love it! Have it also on my new Chuwi HI8 dual-mode tablet so you can add that to the list 

Review 7: Great app! The new version now works on my Bravia Android TV which is great as it's right by my rooftop aerial cable. The scan feature would be useful...any ETA on when this will be available? Also the option to import a list of bookmarks e.g. from a simple properties file would be useful.

Review 8: Really cool gadget for RF engineers Restarts driver when changing orientation. Please fix that. Additionally would like to have MUTE button alongside with other buttons. Another issue is: let user choose whether he/she wants kHz  MHz or GHz when entering freq. Thanks in advance!

Review 9: Fun app - A little tedious though I enjoy using this app but can be a bit tedious trying to get everything set and configured just right. Once your SDR dongle has been properly configured you can then enjoy using it. Nice little app :&gt;)

Review 7: Doesn't connect anymore I've gotten this to work only a couple times  but now it won't fully connect to where you can use properly  my phone will connect to the TV but no picture. Alot needs to be fixed  I would love to continue to use this once it's fixed.

Review 2: Chromecast Connect Done Quickly! Very fast CC connect with one click after opening app instead of 3 or more with CC app. Main screen could feature better design and it needs a Disconnect one click exit too. Miracast isn't working with WDTV and Sony Experia  but Miracast is hit and miss with other widgets. It's a keeper  simplify the disconnect button and make main screen like main Chromecast screen and you have a faster  better CC app than the official one!

Review 3: Simple and effective. Updated to 3.3 (Adds a new option to disable the dialog and launch the screencast settings directly from your launcher) from 3.2 (- Added a new dialog interface when the app is opened so you can get help if needed. - Added a tutorial screen to explain how to cast your screen and answer frequently asked questions about screencasting.) from v2.0.

Review 5: Works fine most of the time but has trouble connecting & sometimes shuts off.

com.mendhak.gpslogger,Negative,"Review 1: Nice app  but has two issues: 1) it does not accept user entered description. I have set up automatic upload to OSM after tapping on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Stop"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and default description. During capturing today's tracklog I customized the description (using the pencil icon in the left bottom corner) to something else to see whether it will be used. Now I see on my OSM account that it has not  the file has the usual default description. 2) often duplicates uploaded files. I have just returned from lunch  I made three tracklogs. Two of them were duplicated. Well  it comes to my mind now that I ended two tracklogs at places with wi-fi (remembered in my phone). So maybe after pressing """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""STOP"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it uploaded the tracklog using LTE  then the phone switch to the wi-fi and for whatever reason the GPSLogger repeated the transfer. Just an idea  mayby that's not what happened. Going to observe it closely.""""

Review 2: Poor accuracy Went for a walk at lunch today. Turned on my phone's GPS and started this GPS Logger app from inside my office building. Took me about 1 minute to get outside  walked about 20 minutes and then turned it off when I got back inside. It said I walked over 7 miles for a route I know is much less than 2 miles. At least this version is better than the previous one  that only logged points if my phone was on and the app was active. What I think should be changed is that when logging it started it should not start until the GPS gets a lock. I think it's using the previous location  which it should not do. And settings should show in their menu item instead of having to select each item to see what the value is.

Review 3: Just what I need  but... Does exactly what I want it for - logging my position so I can geotag photos later - and uses very little battery to do it. It have one little quirk  though. If I have Location Services set to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""high accuracy""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  the app mostly appears to get locations from cellphone towers  not GPS  so you don't get altitude  heading etc. It only uses GPS if you set the phone to """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" GPS only"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (which stops other things working properly). This is not a problem for me at the moment  but it might be annoying at some point.""""

Review 4: Was great  not working with KitKat on N4 Used this for many trails in the past. Will not work when using """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""device only"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" location setting with stock KitKat 4.4.2 on Nexus 4. Dev responded to query - unfortunately all other apps (My Tracks  GPS Status  GPS Essentials  Google Maps) all lock on and record position within seconds. Only this app seems unable to get position from GPS. Pity  as this is unique and useful app. Edit: v48 still has this problem  no position is generated or logged when using GPS-only for location setting.""""

Review 5: This app is so inaccurate  it is laughable. Started it to test it on a short drive to the mall. It seemed to be working fine  but when I turned the screen on while waiting for a traffic signal  I noticed that the distance was twice what my car's odometer showed. And then  as I sat there and waited for the traffic signal  the distance continued going up  so I added 1.5km to my distance while at a complete standstill for about 45 seconds. Eventually  my 8 km drive registered as over 20km. Uninstalled promptly.

Review 6: Doesn't work Tried this because My Tracks is being shut down (Why???). Just couldn't get it to do anything (Nexus 5  6.0.1). It offers Start Logging & Stop Logging buttons  but they don't appear to do anything. App seems to have lots of settings  but doesn't have sensible defaults set. E.g. In My Tracks  it works straight away  saves a file  prompts you for description text  saves it  and shows picture of your route. App needs defaults that work!

Review 7: Needs better support for uploading. Everything works pretty well  except the auto-upload feature. Unless you have it turned up crazy high (uploading every minute)  you will miss data. The settings warn against setting the log filename to a frequent interval  but even with the defaults  you will miss 1 hour of stats every day. If this gets fixed  I'll rate 5 stars  but until then  this app basically doesn't do what it's supposed to.

Review 9: Worthless!!! Walked around the block -- about 5.5 miles with this app logging the walk using default settings. I uploaded the file via email to my laptop and plotted the points on Google Earth. The resulting path is erratic all over the area -- far outside my actual walking path. It recorded a path of nearly 60 miles that I supposedly walked in an hour. This app does nothing useful for me. I'm uninstalling it immediately.

Review 10: Very complicated UI  difficult to use Its hard to know whether the app is logging any points  how many  and how long. I've had several instances where I thought I recorded a track but nothing showed up in the file manager. Why isn't there a blinking green light saying 'recording' and a red 'stop' button? There are some nice features like Dropbox uploading  but the core of the app is hard to use reliably.",5604,"GPS Logger is a free app for the Nexus 4, Nexus 5 and Nexus 6.

com.mendhak.gpslogger,Positive,"Review 1: Good app that could become great with minor changes This app does exactly what it advertises and I have been very happy with the results. It took a few tries changing the settings to get the best results and good battery life. A new feature I would suggest is having the ability to save settings profiles. For example so I could save settings that would log slower for when I hike verse logging faster for when I am cycling or in a car. This app works great with photo goetagging applications  recording bike trails  or recording directions. Thank you for producing a quality product.

Review 2: used to work excellent @ 5star with great accuracy  now lucky to be 2star unfortunately later releases (esp current v60) is terrible regarding consistent logging  accurate logging etc. same hardware  same os  same everything except the app  i use this when flying to track my headings  groundspeed etc. and looking at the current gpx files shows 'fixes' that are way off  i will roll back to previous version cause i am keen to support the development and hope this info proves useful. more than happy to submit further info for dev-debugging etc. cheers

Review 3: Wild readings after upgrading Galaxy S6 to Android 5.1.1 Used this app for 2 years without issue. After Android reflash and upgrade to 5.1.1 am getting wild results when logging that seem to have the GPS fixes jumping all over the place  e.g. Aberdeen Scotland one minute and London 30 secs later  a difference of over 600km. Never had this before. As a registered blind person I use this to log my train journeys and track them on Google using my PC later. Any help to fix what was a really enjoyable experience is much appreciated. Thanks.

Review 4: Perfect for tracking I used this to track my travels through Morocco. It worked perfectly even without any cell or data service available. The interface is super intuitive. The only drawback I have noticed is the times displayed on import into Google Earth  but I'm not sure if that is an issue with Google Earth or the app. The times displayed are adjusted for the time zone difference so if it was noon in Morocco when I was doing something  the Google Earth display will show it as 4am. A bit annoying but not a huge deal.

Review 5: Great app  feature heavy Unlike other similar apps  this focuses on being more 'open'; you're not tied to any services or accounts  instead logging is local and you have a range of options of where to upload and in what format to record data. Dropbox support is a massive plus. GPS naturally uses a lot of power  so I suggest sticking with cell towers if you're in a city  as the precision should be sufficient for most scenarios. Great app overall  aimed at a more technical use case scenario.

Review 6: Great app so far. Working nicely and exactly for what I sought. Was planning to write an app myself for this purpose until i found this. However  some minor issues which I found so far: - I did not get the email function to work with my Gmail address.. I used gmail's smtp server adress and it could validate the SSL certificate just fine. When trying to send the data it gives an error though. I'm not using this function in the long run but thought I'd try it out once for testing purposes.

Review 7: Great app  works ok mostly. Just wish to have settings export/import feature  as amount of setting is quite big to customize. And also will be good to have a cache for """"log to custom url""""  so when i lost internet connection gps points will be store to cache (buffer)  and when the interten connection became active all past gps points will be uploaded  so when i am not having the internet connetion i will not loose the gps track.

Review 8: Tracking bus fleet easy with this app I have a fleet of buses to track and having no problems with this app to out position  speed  direction and even battery state... to a web site url with the information in the url. Set timing to 60 seconds for each post.. Using less than 200mb of data per month to make this happen... which is perfect for the application which costs only $15 per month to save a lot of headaches.

Review 9: Weak and Possible Security Risk This app wants my email password. I only give that to my email client. Why not just invoke the email client to send email? Not many other features  like keying photos to the log. I recommend """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Ski Tracks"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" app over this. Has many more features  and it works fine for non-skiers! (p.s.  Ski Tracks uses the email client so is not a security risk.)""""

Review 2: While the Anysoft keyboard does have some nice features and a neat set of extra characters  it is missing some modern conveniences  such as gesture typing and it feels a bit clunky to switch to other layouts. Perhaps this was useful in the days back when most stock keyboards sucked  but now that Google offers their own  I'm personally not seeing the point  in spite of having used it over a week. It just isn't quick. And over a year from my last review  it would appear that nothing has changed to keep it competitive with other keyboard apps. Back into the dust it goes.

Review 3: Now autocorrects I to IN... every stupid time. I assume not everyone who uses this keyboard is a 12 year old girl. So can we please have the option to replace the stupid emoji key with a full symbol set key that toggles between the standard and symbol keyboards? Some of us have real sized hands and are using this outdoors to communicate... not sitting at a desk in a classroom. Update: now for some unknown reason it is autocorrecting I to IN  and a to an... seriously? This is an deal breaker. Uninstalling.

Review 4: i use this a lot. i'd be happier if i could fix the mostly useless secondary character display on english keyboards. just have to look at other keyboards that do that bit right. NEW problem w/New version sticking around in memory and eating some cpu when not being used anymore. VERY annoying  and only expected from all the shady spying apps. this keyboard really needs more developers who can add more custom choices. i love the potential it has to nicely replace all other conventional keyboards

Review 5: Missing more than a few things I don't use emojis  so a lack of option that allows me to remove that key is a bit annoying  as is the fact that I can't see what symbols each long-press will bring up on the actual keyboard. I don't need a ton of visual features  so this would be my daily driver if I at least had those as options. I would also like to know how many miliseconds each preset for long-presses are. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""fast"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" doesn't tell me very much.""""

Review 6: I like this app  but... This is probably the best Android keyboard ever made. Nevertheless  there are several problems  bugs  and oddities that need to be addressed. I have sent emails to the developer with no response  nor have any of the problems been fixed in the limited and infrequent updates. This keyboard is so close to perfect  but the developer ignores feedback and suggestions. It's a shame  because I would gladly pay for an improved version of this keyboard app.

Review 8: Current version really sucks It actually took me about 1.5 minutes to write just the title for this review  and it was extremely frustrating to try and change the default keyboard  because the selected language kept on changing all the time  so the default definitions were unreachable. I promise to set it back as my default keyboard once this issue is fixed because I really like anysoft. I've been using it for about 5 years now  and I swear I tried others.

com.menny.android.anysoftkeyboard,Positive,"Review 1: Remarkable collection; I use the Dvorak layout all the time. This is really a whole collection of many layouts  including Colemak  separate downloads. On the whole  it's designed well and works very well  but some more attention to detail would not be wasted. A quite-nasty bug  speedy runaway deleting backspace  has apparently been quietly fixed. I'd go bananas with delight if Menny arranged to license FITALY! There's a math. keyboard  but the numerals/figures shifts are no different from those for ordinary text entry. The repertoire of symbols is pitifully small.

Review 2: I love it and need it in spite of its bugs This is the best place I can get a Dvorak keyboard. But it is not without its flaws. First  if I tap to the left of the letter A  the keyboard disappears. Second  it is way too sensitive to accidental taps of the Enter key and should desensitize the soft keys for back and home and menu. I also wish I could stretch each row individually. The saving grace is that Menny cares about what his clients are asking and reporting. One day  I hope he gives me a way to completely customize all aspects of the geography

Review 3: Very good as long as it works. I finally found a custom keyboard that makes typing in english easier without having to use the shift key all the time. But then i tried the hungarian keyboard which messed up everything. I found what i would love to use but i coud'nt get it show up. When i uninstalled it  i coludn't get back to the previous setup. Since there is soo many variations in the settings  it's very easy to get things messed up. Is there a backup for the settings? If there is  you deserve 15* 😃

Review 4: LG Mach (LS860)  ICS 4.0.4. Maps to my physical slider keyboard--- ---Nice to be able to type in Hebrew with real keys.

Working well with my hardware takes priority over those criteria.

Review 5: Where is my semicolon? Thank you so much for responding to my earlier review. I'm delighted to find the semicolon by long-pressing the period - that will work ( still don't see it on any of the symbol screens). Great that the disappear glitch is also fixed.

Review 6: The best keyboard I know. ASK is the coolest keyboard I've ever used. And it gets better. But one thing I don't like is keyboard sound. So  please change it. Water sound isn't a good one. And I kind of like Material Dark theme like that one that Google Pinyin Input has. So  if it's possible please add material dark/light themes. One last thing is it needs to add more emoji smileys. For instance  it has no flags and you'll need to add. Thank you.

Review 6: Not as good as it was. For some reason you now cannot click on an individual note. Also  during rests in the music it puts itself back to the start. Highly annoying. The rating would of been a five last year.

Review 7: very Helpful!!! :) thank you very much!!! But the mere problem is when we tryvto convery it to mp3  the sounds are not that accurate.. its like some notes were missing.. pls update for us. mwuahhh!!!

Review 8: Help! Took forever to install  took forever to startup  and only stayed on for half a second. I scan my tablet to make sure that it wasn't anything wrong with my tablet  and I don't know what to do.

Review 9: Great! Still got one problem though  Lyrics Overlapping..... The first word on the first lines lyrics is overlapped by the first word of the second line when printing. Fix it and 5 star is sure...

Review 10: THE BESSSTTT FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LEARN PLAYING THE PIANO ??? I swear im tireddd of searching for tutorialss in youtube of the song i likee finally i found thisssd ??????",2579,"Reviews are almost perfect, but the speed setting is infuriating. The music is displayed with the right and left hands both in bass cleff resulting in nearly unreadable music with very high notes. The app took forever to install and only stayed on for half a second."
com.midisheetmusic,Positive,"Review 1: LG Mach  ICS 4.04: Great utility made even better Excellent for learning choral music on-the-go  without the weight of my book  with a good stereo headset---also works great piped through speakers at home. I recommended this app to everyone who does part-singing. The option to show lyrics and measure numbers already present is a plus. My community chorus midis are notated that way. Instead of coloring the notes  the option to highlight my part by the line  like a highlighter  as well as the words  with different colors for each  would be better.

Review 2: Fantastic  you might also want to add I love this app! I had quit taking piano lessons awhile back  which I highly regret now  but this app gives me the ability to learn songs easily and quickly. I've also been slow on figuring out base notes however now this app is able to show me what notes to hit which makes learning a song faster. It's awesome that your able to slow down the piece your learning and play along with the player.....*what would really be nice if there was a feature where you could hear the right and left hand separately*

Review 3: Terrific app! This is pretty much what I wanted in a MIDI app for learning to play piano. It allows me to import a MIDI file for a piece and then play it at different speeds  just one hand at a time  etc.  all while displaying the score and scrolling it automatically. I'd gladly pay a few bucks for it  but it's offered for free with no ads. Thank you! One suggestion: It would be nice to be able to save the tempo for a piece across sessions (right now  it seems to get reset to 100%).

Review 4: This application works as expected. There is some issues with certain midi files with improperly programmed sheet music that causes tempo to be out of range of the this app. This is not the fault of the developer. I like how it scrolls through the notes on the sheet music and also like how the virtual keyboard shows you which keys to press. Very handy little app. Kudos to the developer for making this app and it really is ad-free!!

Review 5: This app fits its description I personally love this app  and use it very frequently because when my Orchestra is given new pieces to learn  we get a Midi which we can disect to guide us as well as sheet music. The only other thing I had hoped for  which is why I held a star back  is being able to playback when the screen is locked. I'm hoping that you guys will see the importance of that feature as well.

Review 6: Wow  I love this app! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I don't understand why more people haven't downloaded it. Hopefully the word will get around soon about how good of an app this is. If I had one request it would be that when you go into settings and change something and then you exit the app would keep that setting. But otherwise  I love and appreciate you developing this app. Thank you.

Review 7: Pretty good  great for midi notation  but still lacking in some areas... Desperately needs some more notation features  especially for triplets/duplets/sextuplets/etc. Also needs work on fixing the zoom in vertical mode  notation disappears when you zoom out. Otherwise  extremely useful for notating midi parts from transcribed sequences on the go  helpful in lightening the load for travel.

Review 8: Very Good app. If the scrolling is smooth  it will be much much better. Thank you for the good apps. And i have found a problem on setting. I set not to display second score on song setting  it make mute it too. Could you fix it? Futher  do you make it to play karaoke with score and with sound fonts? If so it will be the best on midi apps. Thank for your help and efforts. Very good app.

Review 9: Good for leaning new tunes! I use it to help play songs by ear. When my ear can't figure something out  it's nice to have notes. It's also great for deciphering chords and rhythms. I play viola  so I'm used to playing and transposing treble clef. I will need to learn the bass clef to make the most use of this app. I suppose an alto clef option would be too much to ask for?

Review 10: Precisely what I need but tempo prob What a great app  if only playback could proceed faster that a beat per second. Because of this it's unusable and will have to be uninstalled for the time being. I will avidly await further development. When it's working right  I'll be able to practice my part on a SATB score any place and time conveniently.",4440,The app is free and available on the Google Play Store.

com.mill_e.twitterwrapper,Negative,"Review 1: Great! I recently bought a new basic android phone to be used mainly for gaming  unfortunately it didn't have that much of internal mem. Then I found out about this  now I can still tweet without the need to worry about space! Even replaced main twitter app on my main phone because i hated how it ate too much space. I only have one twitter account anyways so  this does the trick?????

Review 2: Wanted a small app with as little permissions as possible. This app does it with only one or two but it forces tweets from paid people / advertisers into your feed. Confused me the first few times and isn't right. I understand an ad but forcing someone's tweet on me seems different.

Review 3: Crashes Great concept  but tapping links from my newslists  and then returning to app crashes it everytime. Can't browse my newslists anymore with this app. A real bummer.

Review 4: What's wrong? Why I can't to upload my photo tweet? Then that tweet will save at draft so I continued send it again but same problem come.

Review 5: Hasn't been updated in a very long time. Update: Still not updated. Lowered the rating. Abondoned ware. Time to say goodbye.

Review 6: Good idea  bad product I'm so frustrated! Half of my posts never actually get posted  they just disappear!

Review 7: Can't post images Otherwise great app  but images are grayed out  when I try to post them.

Review 8: Article sharing doesn't work and overall lacks functionality. Just a browser extension.

com.mill_e.twitterwrapper,Positive,"Review 1: This app deserves a much higher rating! The performance of mobile twitter has had its share of ups & downs over time  but this app does exactly what it says it does. I've had a very positive experience  and that's likely due to the developer first  and having a great device with a fast connection online. And I think it's a shame that others don't understand the reasons they had any problems. I wants to thank the developer for making this app available for free  with no ads  and for caring about our collective privacy.

Review 2: I've used Tinfoil for Facebook for a while and was delighted to find I now could replace my annoying official Twitter app also with this excellent lightweight alternative. Only problem is I use two Twitter accounts and the official app lets me switch between them. This app only asks for one account at install. Will multiple accounts be a future possibility?

Review 3: It's very useful  but... It's a great app  a good and lighter alternative to the main Twitter app. Bue I have had this constant problem that I can no longer download pictures from the apo  it just says that the image couldn't be saved. I think it should be fixed as soon as possible. Apart from that it works incredible.

Review 4: Simple and effective This app does almost everything I want it to do. I chose it rather than the Twitter app because it requires a lot fewer permissions and respects my privacy. What would make it 5 stars would be the ability to share Tweets with other apps on my phone such as Telegram so I can send links to friends.

Review 5: Nice I was debating on downloading the official app but I would still have to block or remove permissions and test the app. That takes time  not only is this faster than doing that the app is way smaller than the twitter app. Good job make one for youtube and I will download that one too.

Review 6: Uploading photos This is almost better than twitter. Only problem is when I try to upload photos it force closes. Fix that and I'm definitely uninstalling twitter for this.

Review 7: Real basic  just what I need I seldomly use Twitter  and this app is the perfect approach to it. Don't need an app constantly running in the background and spying on me.

Review 8: Almost perfect This app is almost perfect  it doesn't need many rights and doesn't consume much battery. But recently I can't play videos inside the app anymore.

Review 9: Don't change anything !! I love this browser version mobile twitter! Don't change anything other than more functions&faster speed!! Thanks

com.moez.QKSMS,Negative,"Review 1: QKSMS is an excellently designed app  with an attractive interface and a good feature list  all adorned with the benefit of being open-source! Unfortunately  my experience has failed to live up to my hopes  not because of its design  but because of its performance. QKSMS's interface seems to be very laggy and unstable. It will frequently hang for several seconds  or become confused and take me where I wasn't expecting to go. I often have to set my phone down for a few seconds to let the app sort itself out  before I try and navigate back to where I actually wanted to be. It will occasionally close the keyboard without obvious cause  or boot me back to the conversation list while typing a message. Additionally  it doesn't seem to have good MMS support; all of my MMS messages have timestamps from 1970 in the conversation view and all appear at the bottom - despite the fact that long-pressing an MMS message gives a perfectly fine timestamp. I'd love to love QKSMS  but it doesn't seem to love me back. It would be my daily driver if not for the sad bugginess.

Review 2: It doesn't show all your """"messages in a conversation."""" For Example: If it says you have 15 messages in the conversation you are looking at  but it will only let you go back through """"4 or 5"""" of those messages Only. This is a Big Flaw within this application. Also a lot of the time the UI is extremely slow to respond. I'll give it a few more days to see if the issue's are correctly addressed and fixed. If not then I'll be forced to UNINSTALL This application. Look at the """"bad reviews by the User's."""" If you read them developer you'll then be able to see the issue's within your messageing app. that 6ou missed and the user's have found and fix them. I look forward to an Update with great fixes for the many bugs still in this application. Thanks in advance for fixing this app to work 100% correctly. ☺️

Review 3: Good and light weight APP but needs improvement I am using the APP on Moto E3 POWER  though everything is working fine but I am unable to see old messages in the conversation. For example  at the home screen it is shown 11 messages in the conversation  but if I open the conversation I only get to see 4 messages. I have tried to search for options in setting but couldn't get anything. And second problem is that  the automatically delete option is only related to date  where as option should be their for count of messages also.

Review 5: Doesn't send MMS. Just says Sending Though my settings are right  and though my MMS are delivered withing my stock messagging app . this app doesn't send the same MMS that my stock app does. Without this issue I would give it 5 stars and be happy to pay for it. There are also not enough options for the start button colors to choose from  and no aligment to the right for RTL languages. Missing dual sim support. No different coloring for each contact. There isn't a way to view the mobile network settings instalation messages.

Review 6: Would be five stars except.. I really like it overall but there are many times it won't open. Sometimes when it does open it doesn't show contacts  only numbers. Crashes a lot. For instance  whenever I try to delete something. No easy way (that I've seen) to just save a new number. Doesn't tell me when I get mms messages. It'll have a flag but won't wake up my phone or pop up as a notification if it's already awake. Received pictures show up in a crappy slideshow and are about a tenth of my screen. Can't send videos.

Review 7: Buggy and annoying glitches The MMS stopped working shortly after installing the app. Countless bugs and glitches prevented me from truly liking this app. Maybe in a few years it will working perfectly  but for now I'd recommend steering clear of this app and find something else or sticking to the default on your phone. I feel like usage reports should be used to see how glitchy this app is  because the developers don't seem to be working on the problems (used for two months with always the same bugs and glitches).

Review 10: Group messages are buggy I really like this app. Everything about it is great. But I've had so many problems with group messages the last few days I had to stop using it. I've had contact names/pictures not show up  duplicate messages  and messages showing up out of order. Also  Yappy integration seems to be semi broken. Messages don't always get marked as read and this app doesn't have full MMS integration with Yappy.

com.moez.QKSMS,Positive,"Review 1: This is a very useful application with only a couple of problems. First off  it needs to give the option to click on a contact name when starting a new message conversation. It is very annoying to have to manually enter a phone number that already exists in your contact list. Secondly  it needs to give the option to attach files not just access the gallery. I prefer personally to attach photos directly from my file manager and it will not allow for this. Other than that it is a very useful application. I love the dark and app and black themes period I am legally blind so having a dark theme is a must. It really helps being able to see it and the adjustable fonts are helpful as well.

Review 2: Eliminate the notification pop-up I loved this app as a replacement to my stock LG G5 texting app. However  there does not seem to be an option to disable the notification pop-ups. This is my first non-Samsung phone since the S1  so adjusting to a new phone has proven to be very difficult. All I need is an all-black theme and background in order to save battery power (which this app does have)  and non-intrusive notifications without pop-ups in my face  the latter of which has failed miserably. Add this option  and I will be one HAPPY user!

Review 3: I've really liked it so far! I like the visual customizations  I've never seen an app that lets you customize even the app icon. That being said  it has crashed quite a few times. It also does have a few behaviors that aren't like normal apps  such as double tapping on a message from the lock screen doesn't bring you straight to the message. It just brings you to where you were in the app  which may have been a different message thread. So overall I like it  but the crashing has been just enough to drive me to find a different app.

Review 4: I really like it but.... ..its an awesome messaging app I really like how far this app has come it's awesome and you can now change the text tone and color for each conversation which is awesome only thing left to do is but at least for an sent sound option. I mean even some the other crappier SMS apps have a sent sound so I mean might not be important to some ppl but it should an option. Please! I know it's not a big deal to most people but some people like having a sent sound and go back to the old qksms icon

Review 5: Perfect app  prefer the old icon As the title says  the app works perfectly and I love the quick reply feature. This app fits in well with stock android M apps with material design and such. Could we possibly get the option for using the old icon style as I liked the ability to have the icon the same as my theme and the new icon just doesn't fit with material design in my eyes. UPDATE: Developer responded and applied an upgrade to bring back icon styling  top developer that listens to the community!

Review 6: Five stars So far great app. Fast  light  just what you need. My first time giving a 5 star to an sms app. I might add to have a new option when creating a new message to show recent contacts in the call logs. Also  I suggest putting the timestamp in the middle rather than at the side because it cuts the conversation and it makes the conversation look cluttered. Putting it at the side confuses me also. Would also like to be able to swap between messages while inside the conversation. Pls reply devs

Review 7: Love at first type Open source  smooth  attractive  and checks all my boxes: night theme  color options  option to hide avatars in the conversation list  landscape mode  very wide bubbles for higher information density  etc. MMS works smoothly for me so far too  which wasn't the case for Messenger and Textra. Problems: time stamps pop in slowly in group messages. Group messages also display """"""""""""""""NoSubject"""""""""""""""" instead of the start of the most recent message in the conversations list.""""

Review 8: Amazing Coming from iOS  the only thing I miss is Apple's obsessive attention to detail. So QKSMS is a treasure to me! Fantastic functionality (popup replies  text delay  customisability  proximity sensor  etc) AND design. Things like having the choice to hide contacts' phone numbers on the messaging screen are a really nice touch. Devs: would like to see a grey icon option and some slick animations in Conversations page  but that's honestly all I can think of. Will donate on payday!

Review 9: Nice clean look. Not as much customization as others but that's fine...I do appreciate not being overwhelmed with endless options. I just wished one of the features I really use (delayed timer on messages sent) worked properly. From what I understand it has to be enabled before EVERY sent message...and even at that it still doesn't delay anything (even if I set the delay at 30 sec in the settings). It is a totally free/ad free app though...so I will stop complaining... Thks devs!!

Review 10: Simple & Effective This app is simple to use  extremely good looking (adhere to material design)  especially appearance settings are so easy to use. Does lack some high level customisation offered in other apps but not to worry as not used often. Icon needs some work as it should depict something on sms. QK compose is a superb feature who do lots of sms. Blocking & blacklisting needs development as not much effective. Best part is it doesn't have any ADS",5343,The app crashed quite a few times.

Review 3: Amazing Mumble Client! Two complaints: 1 Though I have authorization for my user I am unable to move/kick others.

I strongly recommend this app for anyone who needs a good mumble experience but can't use a computer.

Review 2: Very good app  easy to use... Some bugs though A little buggy since the most recent android update - mic on Bluetooth headsets no longer activates. Incoming phone calls should auto mute mumble. Phone notification sounds should not play through mumble. I hope those can be fixed.... This app is worth the paid version. Despite those issues  the app is very good and I would still recommend using it.

It is great to allow me to continue working on projects without continually opening the mumble program on my computer taking up screen space or bandwidth.

Review 5: Slight problem I love everything you've done with this app. When I lock my phone or change to another app and come back to it the screen defaults to the server select screen instead of the server I'm connected to. So I have to change it over to be able to talk in the app again. A fix for this would be appreciated.

Review 6: Excellent Mumble App I love the app as a whole  the interface is sensible and intuitive. The only feature I'd like to see is an option to prevent the screen locking  having to unlock when using on screen push to talk mode can be the difference between a wipe and a successful run.

Review 7: It's a good app the only problem i have is that the chat jumps to the bottom whenever someone sends something. So I will be reading through messages trying to catch up on a conversation and every time someone types something i lose my place. Other than that  it's great.

Review 8: Good interface. Just wish that it would be a little more Lollipop or Marshmallow like. Long presses on items would be cool. There is an issue when if you loose connection  like transitioning from WiFi to cell  the app will force close.

And to top it off when I looked this morning instead of showing my wireless connection there was a request for a donation to avoid further messages. That's just cheesy dev. If you want to get paid then make it a paid app  don't call it free and then display these messages.

Review 2: Needs a new classification.. BEGWARE. Seriously  load two of the devs extensions and you get notifications for purchase  for an extension that you're better off buying with a full application such as System Monitor. Why doesn't the dev just bundle all of them and then charge for basically a redundant and useless extension with limited capability? Do not buy  just because the dev is shameless.

Review 3: If You Want Money Ask Up Front I uninstalled all apps and extensions from this developer  because rather than asking to be paid for his work up front  he has his extensions nag you to install an additional paid extension when you are using two or more of them. I have no time for this annoyance.

Review 4: Asking for people to buy Please stop with the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""thank you for using three of my extensions please consider buying......""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There is no option to start in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""now playing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode and there is no access to the main menu from there. Streaming is broken with some (current) MPD versions. Having a notification is a great idea  but the close button should close the client instead of disabling the notification itself. Volume button(s) on it would be handy too. It's not possible to search the library by file/folder name.""""

Review 2: Nice  but not perfect I'm used to play music on my squeezebox with the app squeeze commander. Recently made the switch to mpd. I like it a lot. But the client's for android are not very good (compared to squeeze commander). I miss the random function on songs/genre/year the most. For me that would be a high priority addition for mpdroid

Review 3: Great stuff  but search fails Nice app with a few annoyances.. The biggest one is that the search function does not find a lot of stuff in the db. I have about 7 artists in there named martin... yet only 3 show up in a search. These artists are shown in the artist list  so they are in the db..... Just not found

Review 4: Best app ever. Latest release has bug for me. Google please don't shut this down. Please. The bug is: I can't (add remove and play) when there are files in the active play list. Can't add either from play lists or files. Using Sony z3v 4.4.4 and an old mpd (2 years ago stable)

Review 5: Nice controller but the streaming feature is completely useless. Doesn't play  when it plays a song after minutes of trying it doesn't stop. I couldn't even kill it in app manager I had to restart my s6... The control function is working flawlessly anyway.

Review 6: PLEASE FIX LATEST VERSION This latest version is terrible due to the sliding now playing tab for navigation between library and play que/now playing. It is terrible .when I want to scroll my que  I get the library  when I want the library I get the que.

Review 7: On Moto X Play it is kind of weird. I need to open VLC first (I guess to initialize the DSP?) then enable notification & streaming in MPDroid  and only then it works. Otherwise it plays but no sound. Still usable so 4 stars  but can be better.

Review 8: Adequate for controlling playback of MPD  but streaming does not work on Razr Maxx running stock Android 4.1.2. VLC streams on Razr from MPD perfectly  as does MPoD on iOS  so issue is with MPDroid  not with MPD server.

Review 9: Copyright? Can't believe Google is pulling this app from Google Play. It makes no sense to me that they won't let the author appeal their decision. I truly hope this gets resolved  this is a great app.

com.namelessdev.mpdroid,Positive,"Review 1: The best MPD client on mobile devices MPDroid is by far the best MPD client on mobile devices. It's actually better than several full desktop clients I've tried. It's easy to use  does a great job of displaying cover art (check the mpdroid wiki)  lets you browse by folder structure or by tags and is all round very neat. The only long term annoyance I've noticed compared to a desktop client like gmpc is it doesn't support the composer metadata field but anyway it does let you go to the album folder so if you have any kind of sensible tagging and naming scheme you can always get the info you need. MPDroid improves with each release and MPD + MPDroid still has a place as a great way to enjoy your music collection  even in these days of DLNA/UPNP devices.

Review 2: This app is almost perfect. Though I would have 2 suggestions/requests: 1. The ability it add an image to use as album art. The automatic artwork is about 90% successful  it would be great to be able to easily add missing artwork simply. 2. Add an option to send a user saved SSH command to the source device. For example to be able to send a #sudo shutdown now# command to my Raspberry Pi running Runeaudio would be amazing. Aesthetically I prefer this app but I will have to (reluctantly) keep using the Runeaudio app as it has the shutdown command built in. However  despite the above  this app is way better than all the alternatives I've tried. I hope this is still in development. Please keep up the great work.

Review 3: Pretty decent player Works on my Nexus 7 and on my HP pavilion chromebook (via archon packager and extension). Had to use landscape mode in order to access the now playing handle at screen bottom. In portrait mode they were off screen and inaccessible. The art work functionality is pretty flakey though. I have a lot of albums in a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Various artists"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" folder and none of them work with the art work loading methods being employed as a result apparently. Looks great on the ones that do work though. Maybe I will have to rework that folder into better shape to make more of the artwork accessible.""""

Review 4: Awesome app! Keep it on PlayStore! I usually don't give reviews  but I feel it's necessary now. @dev: I love this app! It makes controlling my MPD-setup feel so natural and easy. I found no other app that can do it better  and I searched for clients on Win  GNU/Linux  iOS & Android. @Google: Didn't you always say """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Don't be evil""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""? What would you call removing an open source app that so many people love from the play store (honest question)? It certainly did not infringe anything. At least tell the dev and don't refuse to talk.""""

Review 5: Support for multiple servers This is a fantastic app. I have built a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""poor man's"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" sonos solution for my house with four zones using Raspberry PI. The only addition that i wuold like to see is the ability to select from a list of servers. I.E. I have 4 RPIs around the house and would like to select the zone i am in to play. I currently use MP Remote for the simple fact that is has the ability to select from multiple servers. If MPDroid had this feature  it would hands down the best app for MPD control. Thanks..... Awesome job""""

Review 6: works for me samsung s3 The app works like a charm.....only two small tweaks and it will be perfect....if the developer could fix the issue when you skip to the next song from the main page while streaming remote or local it would start to buffer right away until 10 seconds after the next song finish buffering......when you skip a song it should play all the way up to the point you skip so there wont be a gap in the song..... also if you try to restart a song from the beginning it would skip to the previous song  other than that it works fine.

Review 7: Streaming is troublesome Streaming will randomly stop when I hit my devices back button. The check box becomes unchecked as well  without user interaction. If a streaming song is buffering  the song will continue to play. This leads to missing 10-30 seconds of a song while waiting for it to buffer. Could there be an option to automatically pause the current song while it buffers? Overall this is the best android mpd client by far. It is very polished  and works consistently in most areas. Please address the streaming problems!

Review 8: All my stars I've been using it over a year now. I have streamed music hundreds of miles over the internet using it in conjunction with SSH tunnelling. I lie in bed reading on my tablet and use it to change the music. I loved MPD before I started using this app  but now my life is complete. This app turns both my phone and tablet into remote controls for my music. It is indispensable. This new release makes it even better; it's as if the developer(s) read my mind and put effort into making it faster and easier to use. N

Review 9: Wonderful MPD client. I use MPDroid to control my Raspberry Pi running music box  and it works nearly seamlessly. A beautiful UI I prefer using instead of the HTML interface built into the distro. My one complaint is that adding albums to the queue adds the songs in reverse order. A couple suggestions: change the UI so that switching from Artists to Albums to Songs works by swiping instead of a drop down menu  change the queue menu so that changing the queue is more gesture based instead of popup menu based.

Review 10: Best MPD client out there. One request though... This is the best MPD client for Android  very responsive and straight forward. I'm using it to control my Pi MusicBox. I hope it will stay in the Play store. One request to the developer though: could you please make the default action when clicking on a song configurable? The default action adds the song to the playlist but I would like to set it to 'replace and start playing'. - - Edit: thanks for replying namelessDev  simple mode seems to be the answer :)",5979,MPDroid is by far the best MPD client on mobile devices.

Review 2: There are many color identification apps  but this one definitely tops the charts! You can share your result to your clipboard or any other app  and it only shares the color code  which allows you an easy  fast  cut& paste. I was using a different app for years and this one is going to save me so much time. Thanks

Review 2: Currently testing nextcloud behind a reverse proxy with client side certificates authentication which adds an extra layer of security on top of nextcloud. When I connect using a browser like Google Chrome on my phone it works great because the app prompts me to select a (client) certificate from the certificate store of my phone however with this app it does not and this makes it impossible for me to connect to my nextcloud server.

I noticed that it only uploads images after enabling this feature.

Take a look at Cirrus  smoother viewing  it doesn't download the full sized image but rather a scaled version (important!)  and preloads the next image automatically.

Review 7: Doesn't work anymore It was so useful  but doesn't work on my new S7  so I switched to Open Link With.

Review 8: Doesn't open I downloaded and there was no shortcut and no open button. Had to uninstall

com.nightshadelabs.anotherbrowser,Positive,"Review 1: This app  underestimated giant that it is  has become one of the most indispensable utilities on my devices. I use it from within so many content serving apps with limited in-built browser functionality to bookmark sync  resolve URLs  & more across preferred browsers  a drawer full of apps to keep them a reach away everyday  all day. It is the ultimate Share app in a long list of sub par alternatives. Kudos to the Dev for continuing to support its development! (=

Review 2: Has one job and does it perfectly This does exactly what it says  and does it well. I know I'm not the only app junkie out there that has numerous browsers installed and uses 2-3 of them regularly depending on what I'm doing. It always bugged me that you can't share to another browser from your current one. It's just a url after all. This handy little app solves that problem.

Review 3: Used and loved this app for a long time. However on android 6 once you set a default browser  when you then share via flashify you automatically go to the default browser  no more dialogue to choose the browser you want 😢

Review 4: Great idea!! When quickly searching the net with the best mobile browser(Google/Chrome) while saving data and getting the best results; you can quickly switch to Firefox desktop if you want the full scoop.😉

Review 5: Very Helpful.. I'm tired by copying web addressees those one of the browsers not support. With this app I can easily share a link and saves my time. Great that it's available for non-root users.

Review 6: Wow! Great flash solution for Xperia z3. Now can use Firefox & Firefox Pro with FlashFox. Please write more niche programs that enhance other excellent programs! Have you considered caller ID??

Review 7: Switching between browser's is now easy using it since I 1st tried this app for switching between browsers i.e.  chrome and Uc . whenever i use new phone i miss this app and install too.

Review 8: Great just for transferring to the YouTube app. Instead of watching a video in a browser this let's you transfer to the YouTube app and watch it there. Worth 5 stars just for that.

Review 9: Godsend I used to copy my links to Clipper  then open Chrome  paste the link and finally open the link. This made opening links from other apps so much easier and faster.

com.nilhcem.hostseditor,Negative,"Review 1: Rated to off balance the idiots People need to understand the difference between temp root  fake root and read/write root (aka true root).

Do NOT hurt the developer because YOU don't understand what your doing. Instead do some research.

Every time when i add host name with ip adres for (host) in clash of clans i enter then i go back in host editor and it isnt ther wtf i doesnt work and i tryd most of apps and some of them work listen im just a kid amd im trying to find the way how to hack my clash of clans and i'm 12 years old and i rooted 5 devices but my older brother cant the oldest is 18 and the older is 12

Review 3: Simple This app does exactly what it should and says: it makes changes to your system hosts file  which on any Linux system requires root access. Every negative rating for this app is ridiculous. Learn how to root your device; that is not the responsibility of the app developer. A hosts file maps an IP address to a host name. If you don't know what that means  this app is not for you.

Device Is Samsung Galaxy Core GT-1860.It Always Says Connection Lost- Connection Lost. I Tryed Everything. I Cleared Cache  I Cleared Catche Data  I reseted My Phone But Nothing. Again Connection Lost.""""

Review 5: Does what it needs to do! Great app! Ignore those 1-star ratings because they are those CoC noobs who doesn't know where they are talking about. Modifying a hosts file doesn't allow you to connect to a certain host and IP  but it blocks the connection to that host and IP. And you need ROOT for this. If you don't know what root is  just don't do anything that needs root.

Review 6: MY COC ALWAYS SAYS """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""CANT FIND SERVER PLEASE CHECK YOUR CONNECTION"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" i cant play coc anymore....i uninstall the coc app then i download it again i open the app then it says """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""CANT FIND SERVER"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" again...PLEASE HELP ME FIX MY COC...BEACAUSE I WILL NO LONGER TO PLAY COC...PLEASE HELP ME...REPLY PLEASE...REPLY""""

Review 7: for all people who says ignore these stupid retarded coc players are retards to i'm a coc player to and when i downloaded it and put the correct ip and name and start coc it says unable to connect to server and i didn't got angry cause i gotta find another way to hack it and for all peoples who have this hacked work are good sports for figuring it out to work

Review 8: Restart CoC If you do this for CoC u you will lose everything and that your time in CoC has just went to trash BUT you het unlimited gems/ gold/ Ex and Dark Ex And Champ and achivements BUT it gets boring:-(   and you can't go back I don't think But I have never done this only saw this on youtube SO I WOULDN'T DOWNLOAD IT FOR COC.

Review 9: Was a great tool for a long time  but after latest Android update it stopped working. My device IS rooted (confirmed by RootChecker)  but when selecting addresses to be blocked and clicking on save  changes are no longer saved. Tried to reinstall  but SuperSU doesn't asks any longer whether to allow root access for it. Had to replace it with Adaway.

Review 10: Very bad I want to kill its developer who have made such a foolish app like him. I think he got inspired from himself of making a donkey minded app. They are for wasting our precious time.

com.nilhcem.hostseditor,Positive,"Review 1: Issues not related to CoC Installed this app to add my dev site to my hosts file. Phone is rooted  app gets permission from SuperSU  my changes show up in the list  but if I refresh the list or close and reopen the app  anything I entered is cleared. Not sure if this is an issue with the app or my phone (ZTE Concord 2)  but all my other rooted apps seem to work fine. 3*'s because the app interface is simple and straightforward 

Review 2: Even handles large hosts files This app has nothing to do with any game  it changes the routing of host names only  you need to know exactly what you are doing  and your phone needs to be rooted first. I have flashed the 'Mother of all add blocking' hosts file  which is too big for most text editors on Android to handle. But this app works fine  even search is fast.

Review 3: ERROR hey I saw this app on a friends phone and it works great for him but when I installed it on my phone the app isn't asking me for root access and hence I can't modify the hosts even though I have root it would say root privileges not there I know this is a great app that's why I gave only four stars it would be five if you could fix this small bug

Review 4: Works perfect. ROOT Required. Works a charm. Loaded a huge 700 000 line hosts file for a few edits and toggles and it took care of it in a breeze. No crashes  no freezes. Those who underrate this clearly don't know what they're doing and should underrate themselves. ROOT required. Suggest you mention that in the heading too.

Review 5: Learn to root people This app is perfect. People whose like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""wut iz root?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" are newbs. U can't hack coc or make it dev version. U can make a private server but that means your own server. U can't attack people whose on the real server of coc. Just wanted to clear things xD""""

Review 6: I had avoided advertisings by editing hosts file in my pc bit then I met adblock   it's kinda fun to keep unwanted adds away from your screen. It's a great way to avoid advertisings. It will be useful for phone users too. But I don't wanna root ?..... Rooted users should definitely give a try.

Review 7: Good app My coc is private server now and iam happy for 777777k gems and 100000k but iacant back my coc and next update plsss you could find a clan to my member plsss thank you for creating this app and the other is bad your good and your supporter by:charles

Review 8: Awesome This app is really great and easy to use. If you're having problems with it make sure the server your trying to connect it to is up to date with  for example  clash of clans otherwise it won't work plus some servers are shut off after some time

com.nkanaev.comics,Negative,"Review 1: Super simple... But it has major problems with large images :( pixelates the heck out of them  which can make small text unreadable  and it stays pixelated when zoomed in. No other reader does this  which is a shame because I like bubble better than the others :/

Review 2: clean layout (in comparison with all others readers in android marketplace)  but it doesn't HOLD the comic you're reading... The minute you switch to another app and back  it returns to library. That makes it unusable.

Review 3: Can't open from sd card Can't tell whether the app is any good since all my Comics are on the phones sd card and the reader won't open it. And while trying to open a file it crashed and won't open any more.

If you don't add these you will not stand out among the rest apps. Keep it up!

Review 2: Simple  Sober & Beautiful I am able to read the comics that even established comic readers failed to. And cherry on top is that it's completely free without any ads. It's very light weight and there's no distractions while reading. Kudos to the developer for this amazing comics reader.

Review 3: So far so good. I tried other comic readers and my perennial favourite Comicrack but all these comic readers somehow have difficulty reading from SD card. Not sure if it is due changes made in Android. This one reads comics with no difficulty. And so easy navigation and very intuitive.

Review 4: Love this beautiful comic reader! Thank you so much the the developer and or developers! This is one of the best comic book readers I've come across and it ease of use make it even better! Love the material design and I can see this being my number 1 comic book reader!

Review 5: Love it Tried other readers and this is by far my favorite. If you want all sorts of features  look elsewhere. If you want a super simple reader that just opens your comic and let's you read it without a ton of nonsense  this is the one you want.

com.nolanlawson.keepscore,Negative,"Review 1: I once considered this to be a rock-solid app. More recently (since late 2016)  I have consistently seen crashes once I open a game with 10 to 15 rounds in them. It took me a while to realize that I could recover the scores by exporting the game to a spreadsheet  which I suppose is a work-around. I would really appreciate a real fix  however.

Review 2: Crashes on Nexus 6P I loved this scorekeeper so so much! It's such a great design. For some reason that I haven't figured out yet  it just keeps crashing every time I use it. Thankfully the scores are saved  but I makes it almost unusable. I may have to look elsewhere which is sad :(

Review 3: Great app  but unstable I pull this out for Star Realms and it's just the best way to keep track of authority instead of using those dinky cards. The only issue (which is a big one) is that the app randomly crashes multiple times per game. Would rate 5 if the issue were fixed.

Review 4: Keeps crashing on OnePlus One. Multiple times per game. Was fantastic on galaxy phone but it's so infuriating especially as the warning dialogue box obscures the view of the scores so unless you remembered (rendering a score keeper unnecessary) the score you are screwed.

Review 5: Nice simple score app  but crashes Nice simple score app  would give a top rating  but some saves seem to get corrupted and crash every time they are opened after an initial crash. This happens about 1 in 4 games on Nexus 5x.

Review 6: Crashes and then resets score. If the sole purpose of the app is to keep the score  there is no point to it when it crashes and then resets the scores you have. Shame because it's simple to use with a good layout.

Review 7: Broke on the Galaxy S5 Does not work on the Galaxy S5. Can't make any option changes or even set a (rematch) when the game is over. It would be great to be able to set a finishing score for games like cribbage.

Review 8: Crashes at Round 13 with 2 players Once the app crashes  although the game is still in the main list  trying to access it closes the app and the scores are unobtainable. Ruined the first game I tried with it.

Review 9: Been using this for years. Brilliant app. Why only 1 star then? Because it has not had an update for over a year. In the meantime I have updated my phone to Marshmallow and now the app crashes all the time.

com.nolanlawson.keepscore,Positive,"Review 1: Just what I was looking for to track family games This app was perfect for my needs. Needed something that I could easily keep score in various games and customize the values so that it was quick and easy to use and get rid of paper & pen. This app did that  and it had what it needed to do it well. Things like keeping the screen on  and also being smart enough that if I hit +500 +100 +100 that I was saying +700 for that person for a turn. Works perfectly. Now my only 3 things I would love to see to make this app even better. 1.) When exporting to PDF find a way to export all that same information that you can see in the game history like in the app. Then you can make nice tables/graphs in excel with the data and see the nice time/score layouts. 2.) The 4 on screen buttons are by far the most important for me playing games with high point values. I was able to work with just 4 but it would be nice if you could customize to add a few more if desired. 3.) I have not made a mistake YET but I know I will especially with drinking games. If I hit +500 points to somebody and meant to hit +100 I wish there was either an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""undo"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button or there was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""inverse"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button. Meaning do the opposite of a buttons value to fix mistakes.""""

Review 2: Great little App. I use it as a coach to keep score for our Futsal training. We divide the boys into 4 teams and if 1 team scores they stay on and the other comes of to be replaced by one team waiting to get in. If no one scores after an amount of time then both teams come off or if there is only 3 teams then the team that has done a double shift comes off. The only thing this is missing is a count down timer and then it would be perfect!

Review 3: A great score keeping app  but...... Thank you for your great score keeping app. Please consider the adding the following options: 1) The option to select individual players or teams. 2) The option to choose a final score and record the frequency of the victory of the player or team when the final score is achieved. The app should declare which player or team reaches the preselected final score and record the frequency of the victories.

Review 4: Great for Zombie Dice and Star Realms! Would you be ready to add some kind of customization option to keep track of non-linear points? Would need a way to add multiple always visible columns of user-entered numbers for each player and then a pointer to show which number each one is on currently. (Player stats for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""betrayal at house on the hill"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".)""""

Review 5: Great app  needs work The app is great except for entering large numbers  you have to click on too many things. Change it so that a click on the players score opens the entry box with an active cursor. This would make the app so much better. It would also be great to be able to insert the game's name. Otherwise I love the features and it is very easy to use.

Review 6: The best ever! I have tried several apps like this and none would be as good and functional as KeepScore. The app is fantastic... It has a great (and customizable) interface  it's extremely simple to use and here's what I liked most: You have lots of settings to play around with  such as defining how much score each button will increase or decrase.

Review 7: No better scorekeeping app! Updating my previous review from 2 to 4 stars. The dev reached out to me and let me know that when leaving the app  the games are saved in the list of saved games  so the scores preserve. Only complaints are the menu overflow button appearing on Nexus devices but that's not a big deal. Seriously is a very useful app.

Review 8: Perfect I just downloaded this and I love it. Has every option I wanted like keeping track of scores for more than one game with different number of players  adding points by +/-10  5 1 and even able to customize those buttons. I'm sure there are going to be more surprises for me to find too.

It is also essential for tweaking performance and monitoring health. This is the only log viewing app I've found so far that I think should be included with the Android OS.

Review 2: It works without root after enabling the READ_LOGS permission for it  using adb: `pm grant org.jtb.alogcat android.permission.READ_LOGS` and restarting the app. This is needed on the newer Android versions. Please update the description to get one more start.

Pls give a choice of fonts or have the same one as the app. Pls fix soon..

Others out there either try to much or have too much going on.. Gets tiresome especially when you just need a 'to do' list. One suggestion would be more refinement in the Material Design UI. Still feels a lot like jelly bean/kit kat. That and perhaps more theme options? Oh and updated notification icon? Otherwise thanks for a great app.

Review 3: Awesome task app Great app  especially love the minimal/customizable widget that comes with it.

Review 6: Nice n Simple Great works. Sync to SD is very nice. Could you please add sync to caldav with vtodo and simple vjournal. Thanks..

Review 7: I like it... I really like all the features. But it could use some kind of widget. No other notebooks I've found has that!!

Review 8: Suddenly unable to sync Makes this pointless. Loved this app. Fix it and easily a 5-star app. LG G3 on 5.0

com.notriddle.budget,Negative,"Review 1: Doesn't crash  about all I can say for it. This app doesn't crash  which puts it ahead of some other envelope apps i've tried. However  its features are really lacking. Settings don't work  envelopes can't be edited  the interface is so streamlined that I can't features I need. This app is half finished.

Review 2: Can't set budget amount This essential feature is missing. Also  long-clicking an area should bring up options to delete it. Very unpolished.

Review 3: Budgeting? !?!? This is more of a check register than a budgeting app",549,The app doesn't crash which puts it ahead of some other envelope apps i've tried. However  its features are really lacking. Settings don't work  envelopes can't be edited  the interface is so streamlined that I can't features I need.
com.notriddle.budget,Positive,"Review 1: FINALLY a Decent Envelope App!! I have tried kinds of envelope budgeting apps and I have lost count of how many of them I have uninstalled. This one is clear  easy to set up and sooooo not complicated. You add your money to the envelopes and enter what you spent. BAM! Done. No figuring your budget based on when you get paid and all that complicated stuff. Just you and envelopes. Plus if you have a question or problem  the creator of the app will actually reply to you and very quickly. Thsns so .much for making this app!

Review 2: Better than Good Budget Cash is the way to go for budgeting and I tried Good Budget for several months and it's just over kill. This is simple and easy. Add the money  take it out or transfer it. Please don't add a whole bunch of other features. The beauty of it is that you can add lots of envelopes. When you think about it  paying your bills didn't get you in trouble with the budget  it's the other ways you spend your money that are the problem. Really happy to have finally found something that works!

Review 3: I HAD to review this app. I was not looking for a budget/finance app with all kinds of bells and whistles like so many out there even ones that say """"Envelope Budgeting"""". What I needed was tracking cash in actual envelopes which is pre-budgeted  as in $150 for groceries for half the month (pay day is 1st and 15th). This works beautifully and simply. I almost deleted it though in frustration when I entered an expense and needed to delete it and couldn't figure out deleting. Swipe left worked. Yay.

Review 4: Five *s This is the only app of its kind. There are many budgeting apps  but this is the only one that very simply does one thing. No connection to your bank accounts  no dropbox sync  no default list of 150 spending categories. You put money into an envelope  you take money out of the envelope when it's spent. Plain. And. Simple. And  it looks good too!

Review 5: Simple  easy I haven't worked out how to delete envelopes or mistaken entries yet (I don't think you can) but otherwise it's working great. You can color code envelopes  add a note to any input or out put and it doesn't pressure you to keep to a schedule like some other apps. A handy way to record where your money is going and where you want it to go.

Review 6: Puristic and helpful - just my taste I use this App to keep track of my money. It always gives me a clear conciousness of my finances. Also  discrepancies between the values in this app and my wallet/bank account will alarm me of unforseen/overlooked transactions. Many thanks to Michael!

Review 7: Simple app to track budgets I really like this app because it looks good and is just simple to use. It would be nice if envelopes could be set to automatically refill based on the month. And in case anyone is wondering  to delete an envelope just swipe left. That wasnt immediately clear.

Review 8: it could be so much more... Fantastic app to track out goings....but....Please update and add features like the option of be able to Add salaries or money coming in the bank. Also the option of reaccuring bills or expenses. Just a few improving sugestions. Well done so far!

Review 9: love how simple it is. Easy to edit payments or remove  once u play around with it a bit to work it out. Graph only works if u go into envelopes and hit the paint bbrush to assign a colour to each envelope. Took me ages to work it out. Needs a simple tutorial or q&a

Review 10: Simple Easy to use I would give it 5 stars but it seems to be missing one important (to me) feature. All of my envelopes work on %. So when I get a paycheck it would be nice to automatically divide it into my envelopes instead of manual entry.",3721,Envelope budgeting app is simple and easy to use.

com.numix.calculator,Negative,"Review 1: omg! the loudest pop-up ads ever! actually  quite impressive  the volume that is. needless to say  I'm going to have to uninstall this app.

Fortunately found this and after installing.... Yeah  that's exactly what I was looking for ? . Just the widget ... It is useless  but can be ignored. ?

Review 2: Not Material the status bar is not transparent  theres not animation like the L calculator and on L it crashes. Im not sayin is a bad app but i dont know why you cant try the material design guidelines But anyway i hope this is going to be a great app and better than the original L calculator ;)

com.numix.icons_circle,Negative,"Review 1: Updates kind of ruined it I used to love this icon pack  it was simple and colorful. Then a month or so you introduced the white borders around apps  and now colored masks. For me the white was already a step in the wrong direction because it made the non themed apps really stick out  and the new masks amplify this to the point that it completely ruins the look for me. I know you can't please everyone  but it would be great if you could revert back to white  or even better if this was customizable through the app. Keep up great work

Review 2: Official background on sabbatical? I cannot  no matter what direction I come at it  make the official background show up on my Samsung Galaxy Tab II  using Nova Launcher Prime. I've gone in through backgrounds  Numix Circle App  and Nova  but it just defaults to that stupid water droplet factory default. Was it something I said? Did I move too fast  come on too strong? I just wanted the purty background all to myself  to touch and to hold and to call George... Help?

Review 3: Not worth the download. For the amount of icons provided  it's not worth the memory it'll take up on your device. Slightly over 250 icons (essentially will skin probably about 5% of ALL icons on your device  so hardly even good)  basically abandoned as of now  and not that special to begin with. Even being free  it doesn't matter. Not enough icons to warrant a download.

Review 4: Looks great  but doesn't apply icons to all apps I don't have most of the apps with Numix icons this might not apply to all of them  but it doesn't work with Sync for Reddit. Maybe it doesn't recognize it from the name change (from Reddit Sync?). It's stored on my device as com.laurencedawson.redditsync_pro-1 where the icon in Numix doesn't have the -1.

Review 5: Why we need a launcher? I just want to know why do we need to have a launcher in order to change icons on the phone? Why can't it be simple like changing icons as you do it on your computer? There are some great icon packs but can't use them as they need some stupid launcher. The rating is for the same. I give 4 stars to the theme.

Review 6: Update has broken the icons I enjoyed this icon set for a long time but the latest update has caused the gmail icon to turn into a settings gear and the Messenger for Facebook app is not a bunch of squares in a circle with a leaf on it which makes no sense at all. Will rate once again if/when this bug is corrected. -ASUS ZenFone 6

Review 7: Nice but a lot of stock icons are missing... The supplied icons are okay  but it's kind of weirs when some icons are round while others are square. Several stock icons are missing  like eBay  telephone etc... as well as icons for all the games i have...needs a lot of work to reach 5 stars in my book.

Review 8: Not working correctly since update Hi Numix. Looks like suddenly icons are strange colors and shapes. Really not a fan of the pink. Numix crashes when I try to add custom icons from ADW launcher. What's up? Kinda bummed out. Was a huge fan of the previous version. Could I perhaps get an apk for it?

Review 9: App is garbage. I'm sure it does look nice when it works but every setting I clicked on force closed the app  when I was asked to download the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""free calculator"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the app force closed on me and all of my icons are just stock icons with a white background. Cool.""""

Review 10: 4 of 80+ apps changed Absolute disgrace  4 apps changed  one being chrome and THE REST GHAD THE UGLIEST circles and your app just shrunk the remaining 80 apps and slapped them on those dumbaassss uglyass circles . Edit: Jan 2015 STILL SUCKS amazing on Ubuntu-Gnome 14.1 though ! :p",3691,"The Numix Circle App is a free icon pack for the Samsung Galaxy Tab II. It is available for iOS and Android devices. The app is free and available on the Google Play Store. There are 250 icons, which is about 5% of all icons on your device."
com.numix.icons_circle,Positive,"Review 1: Looks almost as good as the Linux circle icons I was hoping like crazy that Numix would release circle icons for Android. I've been using their circle icon pack and Window/GTK+ theme on Linux for a long time and love what they have done with Linux theming. It's great that they have entered the Android market since the devs are very talented. To people who are saying that they are missing icons  aside from giving them time since they are always looking for more icon suggestions  if you are running a alternative launcher like Apex or Nova  you can manually change the icons that aren't changed from this app. And to the guy griping about them not making icons for Samsung's proprietary bloat software like S Note  Lol. Also  really  why would they have the Tardis wallpaper? I'm surprised they aren't getting into legal issues by showing it in a screenshot. Go bust out your Google-fu and look for it.

Review 2: Beautiful Albeit Unstable The icons in this app are among the most cosmetically appealing I have ever seen. But with that in mind it also is not without faults  it is seems the app is unable to do anything  when opened  other than crash. I have also tried to utilize the request an app feature but to no avail. As it either crashes when using it or will outright not send the attachment regardless of which program I choose to use to send the damned thing. So all in all this app is wonderful in how it looks but that's truly it.

Review 3: Great until masks I appreciate the concept of adding masks and forcing circles to every icon  but frankly it looks terrible with certain apps. Ones that stuck out were the Stack Exchange app  the Verge app  my launch dock and anything else that features an icon incorporating alpha. I will admit that particular apps looked relatively nice. QR code reader seemed almost native to numix  Fandango looks swanky but acceptable however these few do not outweigh the barely recognizable icons now cluttering my phone. Love your work!

Review 4: My favourite icon pack for Android Numix Circle looks great on my Cyanogen device. The uniform circle shaped icons add eye candy and simple look to the App Drawer. In addition  the icon masks maintain uniformity of shape for the few missing icons. A big thanks to Numix team for creating and maitaining this quality icon pack on both Android & Linux desktop.

Review 5: Great Icon Pack  Needs More Icons I love to use these icons on Linux along with their great theme but for some reason they are lacking a few staples needed for a decent pack. No phone icon for instance. I still appreciate them bringing this to android but they need to update it. I would gladly pay a few bucks if it meant I was getting a complete pack.

Review 6: Almost there Awesome icon pack. Really sexy and I love the 'polished' look of it. Just one thing  can you make it compatibe with Solo Launcher ? Its one of my favourite launchers and I have to install another launcher in order to use this icon pack. If you can make it compatible with Solo Launcher that would be superb. Please devs :'(

Review 7: Simply amazing! It's really great but could you add more icons  please? Add more icons for: phone  messaging  DU Battery Saver  LINE Play  Simeji  music  and Ayakashi: Ghost Guild. Thanks! Looking forward for more of your updates. Once you have added the icons I asked  I'll change my ratings to 5 stars. Keep up the good work! :D

Review 8: The best icon pack I've tried a few different icon packs but even if numix does not update it as often as the linux version  the look is much better than other popular icon packs. Also all icons even if they are not updated will be the same size which gives the home pages a clean look which is not seen on any other icon pack

Review 9: Good with a few quirks Update: Better  the custom icons look awesome and masks have gotten better. However  it still lacks support for many major games such as Clash of Clans  Injustice  and boom beach to name a few. Also a good number of major apps missing custom icons  namely the weather channel. Besides that  it's great

Review 10: Love these Icons  5 Stars! :D I use this pack for my computer as well (I use Elementary OS  a linux distro)  and I love it! It encompasses nearly every ever app I use and never breaks the theme guidelines. I find it a wonderful addition to computers  tablets  laptops  and more :D Thanks for the amazing pack Numix Team",4427,The Numix Circle icon pack is available for the Android market.

I connect using the app and then lock and unlock ny phone  the app does not auto login and then this causes problems  which means i have shut down the app and disconnect from the hotspot and then reconnect. Also the connection drops out with this app all the time which is annoying.

Review 2: Way to buggy and it's lacking features. When I click on an ap on the map  most of the times it won't go back to full map view or it will jump back at my location. Annoying as hell. Also  there isn't an option to configure my 2405a anywhere... Since you disable this feature from the web site  you must do something about it.

I even tried to initialize the download from my computer and it does the same thing. I like the idea  but if I can't get it working... no good!

Review 4: Causes wifi connectivity problems This app constantly causes the wifi connection to drop  whether its a FON network or not. My phone would only stay connected to a wifi network for 1-2 minutes before disconnecting  and would sometimes not reconnect. After uninstalling this app  my wifi works fine.

Review 5: App OK but service is poor App functions OK but repeated connection issues and inability to connect at all between 5pm and midnight... Frustrating to not be able to use a service for large chunks of time (particularly when allowance is awarded in 24hr chunks).

com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Negative,"Review 1: I've read your faq; forums does not exist. There is not a button to get back to settings  more options pauses  even using accessibility on S7. It is running too fast without speed controls. I like that I can use the touch screen which is missing on some other DS android emu. If I could access settings and make sure frames were not being skipped & you did not condescend and call players names  then you would have a higher rating. I am looking for help and professionalism and you serve neither. I don't have crashing issues  just the too fast and one time on install only settings issue.

Review 2: Work fantastic  just a few minor flaws Brilliant emulator  some frame rate drops can be forgiven and doesnt affect the gameplay  just have to be a bit more patient! One thing that the issue with me is the menu of the emulator wont work. Im using a Galaxy S6 Edge  i dont know if this is a common thing but i guess you could say the overall experience as i cannot change any settings / access the main emulator menu etc. If this is fixed  i will ABSOLUTELY change the review to 5*. Like i said  gameplay is pretty much faultless  just the menu issue...

Review 3: Good emulator  but... I can't find any way to access the emulator's menu for dropping framerates or loading a save state on my galaxy s7. When I used to use it on my s5  long pressing the recent apps button opened it  but that doesn't work on the s7 since they changed that button's functionality. I tried long pressing the back button as well since that's where they moved the options shortcut  but it didn't work. It'd be great if you added a menu button to the screen or made the long press on the back button work within the app.

Review 4: Works and it doesn't Everybody is talking about how slow it is  but on my galaxy s6 it works as fast as it should. My problem is that it crashes. It has an auto save feature  but what's the point of it if it doesn't work? Maybe it's the way pokemon saves  but it crashed on me as I was about to save it. It auto saved right before it crashed  but when I went to open it back up it started me where my LAST save was. Not happy about it because I can tell how frustrating it's going to be in the future. Save often is all I gotta say.

Review 5: Didn't like it very much. Seems to be an Okay emulator. The options and layout leave a lot to be desired though in my opinion  app needs to be simpler and going back and fro while searching for ROMs needs to be pleasant. For some reason it wont detect ROMs stored in any other folder but Downloads. Another negative is it heavily lags on games like Pok?mon (~20-25fps Lowest settings) while Drastic handles the games just fine. However its free and based on desmume so thats nice. Compatibility with desmume on PC is priceless!

Review 6: Runs terribly choppy and slow. Frame rate was never stable. Only once did I experience steady FPS  and that when there was nothing for the engine to draw. Poor performance overall. Trying to adjust the controls was an absolute head ache. The inputs of the d-pad and the buttons could be resized  but its gets all jumpy when you do. Trying to adjust the layout of these controls to work with your device is made very frustrating because of this. It can emulate games  but you wouldn't want to play them on this platform.

Review 7: Go Buy DrasticDS This is pointless and not even supported anymore because the developer knew he wasn't going to start from scratch to get it running up to full speed. DrasticDS is written from scratch from the ground up to natively work with Android devices  that's why it's full speed and you can even enhance the graphical settings. It even runs on my old 1 core cheapo Android phone that I have as a backup. Save yourself the trouble and do not download this. It is not being developed anymore anyways.

Review 8: Keeps Crashing. Very glitchy. Lost all data Was in the middle of playing Pok?mon White when the game crashed when a pokemon FINALLY gained EXP points! When I came back to this app  only option I could do was start a new game! What! All my game data had been erased even though it kept slowing the game down with its stupid auto save every now and then! Wtf! I don't want to start all over again. Please get rid of the auto save! It doesn't do anything except slow the game down! Otherwise  not bad app.

Review 9: Pay for DraStic  it's work it. It works sometimes. Often it would fail three or four times before opening. It would run slow  skip frames  sound was choppy  and to top it all off it would crash making me lose all my unsaved data. I tested over a few days and if anything it seemed to get worse. I lost almost twice as much time/progress then my save file had on it. If you're diligent and spam save after every conversation/battle may be tolerable but I couldn't stand the crashing. Uninstalled.

Review 10: Difficult Navigation I have multiple ROMs downloaded  but for some reason the app only shows one  and there is no way in the app to look for my other games. There is also no way to skip frame rate  turn off sound  etc.  all there is when in a game is the touch button  the normal DS buttons  and an icon in the lower right of my screen that only freezes the game. If these two problems could be fixed for the S6  that would be awesome.",5308,The app is free and based on desmume so its nice.

com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid,Positive,"Review 1: There's something missing... the emulator plays well even its slightly slow you need a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""portrait"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""landscape"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option  switching from main screen to the second screen prompt by pressing a button  your START'SELECT and TOUCH button are too small for my big fingers and lastly improve the fps of the emulator because I really want to play Pokemon Diamond and Castlevania:Dawn of Sorrows. I hope you improve your project of the nds4droid? really look forward for the future....... Cheers.""""

Review 2: Pretty awesome..missing two things Finds and opens nds files well. I assume no archive support as others were complaining...they should unarchive their roms before trying to play or rate your app low. It is missing the speed mods. And the quick savestate and quick load state are a poke fans bread and butter  having to press extra buttons to save state or load state is relatively tedious. If that could be added as soft buttons or as an option to add them as soft buttons then that would be it  it would be a 5 in my book. Thank you so much!

Review 3: Pretty good  and worth downloading. Considering so few have managed to develop decent Nintendo DS series emulators - on smartphones/tablets OR computers - this is actually a pretty good effort! The interface is great and whilst there is a little bit of sluggishness  the most recent update ensures that most games are playable  even with the sound on (which doesn't seem to affect the performance too much). All that's needed is a little more tweaking for smoother gameplay and this would be perfect... I used Pok?mon Black for my testing.

Review 4: Has gotten a lot better This emulator has come a long way. When I first tried using it two years ago  it is nearly impossible to play Pokemon. Now  the game can be run with a slight lag on my S5. The app crashes at times  but the autosave feature is a huge saving grace  especially for Pokemon. If the app is really acting up  restart your phone and it should crash less frequently. I don't expect much from a DS emulator for my phone  so I am satisfied by this app. I wouldn't have played these games if it wasn't for the app.

Review 5: It really works without bios it's good app but there are problems that need to be fixed like. It's control transparency it won't let me change them but it's not a big deal. It's graphics is not that good little blurry. Pretty slow actually even without sound it's slow it's actually the main problem. But overall it's not that bad my phone is CM S5mini it's Android 6.0 low ram but emulators Should work in it's almost max speed and features cause it's an emulator if the problems are fixed I'll give 5 star overall

Review 6: I got this to play pokemon and everything manages to works almost perfectly. The only issue I have is that occasionally the game will crash when you reach 100%(like when you're entering a new location and loading) but luckily the emulator has an auto save feature  and also just make sure you save before entering a new area in case the emulator crashes. It took a few minutes to figure out the saving features  make sure you go to loaded games and avoid using quick save as well since it's a bit more reliable.

Review 7: Not bad Downloaded with no problems  opens and works fine  for those trying to play pokemon it works for heart gold specifically. To get it to run the most efficiently turn off autosave  set frame skip to 9 when reading dialogue and set it to 3-9 when walking depending on your preferences  turn the screen scaling off  turn off audio but this is optional  and save(in game) every time you gain a level. I'd give it a 5 star but the frame rate is crap while walking but just a small price for a free ds and th

Review 8: This is a wonderful app  and works far better than one would think being free. The devs came up with a simple solution for the lower screen it can be switched between controls and screen by pressing a button. There is a problem where games animation will be slower on all but the simpliest games  but it is updated fairly regularly so it is running far better than when it first launched. So I can see it dissapearing in a year or two. Beyond that everything else works wonderful.

Review 9: Nice Emulator Best free emulator in Google Play. Just need to be fixed sounds and faster  smoother game play but beside that; it is still a great emulator. Also I really appreciate that you put hard work to make this easy-to-use emulator and people need to know that all emulators are supposed to be slow  because the games are meant to be played on Ds and some ROMs don't work because they just don't work. Best of luck improving your Nds Emulator!

Review 10: Considering so few have managed to develop decent Nintendo DS series emulators - on smartphones/tablets OR computers - this is actually a pretty good effort... The interface is great and on my Kogan Agora 6+ smartphone  the emulation is smooth  even with sound enabled. I only have a couple of Pokémon titles at this time  but considering how smoothly they run  it might be worth looking into other Nintendo DS series ROMs. Highly recommended!",5185,The app is free and available for download from Google Play.

com.owncloud.android,Negative,"Review 1: It just freezes all the time now. When it wasn't freezing  i wanted to use it to free up space on the phone  but since downloaded files remain on the phone forever  it is pointless. And i had to learn the hard way that deleting files outside of the app also deletes files in the cloud. I don't get the feature which lets me automatically upload photos  which takes twice the amount of space and every photo on the gallery is duplicated. Very annoying. I have regretted paying money for this since the day after i bought it and saw it for what it really was. I've tried getting back to using this app several times to see if it improved  but it's just the same or worse.

Review 2: Needs improvements Still needs improvements. Everytime an automatic upload fails it does not restart. This is specially annoying if you have a slow connection. I have to go to the app and retry everything. This is bad because I run the risk of pressing """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""clear failed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and then I don't know what was uploaded and what wasn't. It is a huge problem if I have a lot of files to be backed up. It makes me not trust the app and think it's unreliable. A quick way to notice what files are uploaded would also be nice.""""

Review 3: Looking for features? If you are looking for features this is not the right app for you. It seems like the app wasn't updated for ages. It's not possible to sync a whole folder which makes it exhausting to sync anything. You have to open a folder and click each file seperately. Also it is not possible to sync periodical or on file change. However the app connect to your owncloud server as a charm and seem to download / upload single files well. Not exciting for advances users though.

Review 4: Not trustable Why there is even a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""retry failed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option? Shouldn't it keep trying uploading until successful? If I miss the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""retry failed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option and have the bad luck of accidentally chose the next option (""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""clear failed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""") I loose track of what is synced and not... Can't believe I paid for this while there are free options that are better.""""

Review 5: Version 2.3.0 Broken This App is amazing  it usually provides all the functions I need  however the current version appears to be unusable. I tested it on my phone (Android 5.1) and on my tablet (Android 4.4) on both devices it appears that the app doesn't react to any touch input  which makes the app pretty much useless. Please fix it because until now it really worked flawlessly for me.

Review 6: This app is effectively useless. You cannot sync files larger than about 2MB. Because it stops syncing when the app is terminated  every time your phone goes to sleep or you switch apps  all your syncing will fail. The OwnCloud app doesn't resume partial uploads  or retry failed uploads... it just lets everything fail. Even if you retry  you'll just hit the same problem again.

Review 7: Definitely needs a select all button when uploading from DCIM folder. Auto upload only works for images taken that day. I only turn the server on occasionally so have lots failed upload attempts. I would like the option to only auto upload over a specific (home) wifi and also to prompt because there is no point attempting the upload if I know the server is off.

Review 8: Really disappointed with the app due to the following: (1) it crashes all the time.. like literally all. the. time. (2) it doesn't sync files when they're changed via phone (3) after downloading some files to the phone  they just disappeared from the cloud. Concluding  there are severe stability and robustness issues  while necessary features are missing.

Review 9: Sorry but I was used more a year and was work but now is 3 month when come nougat and 3 month no one care there is not work instant update automatically. That is and update and still didn't work for LG v20 and galaxy s7 this device was reported 3 month ago and still didnt work. When you fix it I change thit review but now is not useble for me.

Review 10: App worked for about 3 days and instant upload stopped working. Very upset about this. Great app when it's working. Owncloud needs to work on this app more. Several other people have the same problem and nothing has been done especially if it's a paid app. Debating trying to ask for a refund.

Review 2: Very good client I was hesitant to pay for an app that did not know that would suit my needs in the first place. Well  after I set my Owncloud on a rpi and downloaded this app on my Android phone  everything works like a charm. My photos now are getting backed up automatically. If only there was an option to delete original files from phone after having been backed up.

Review 3: No problems for two years Contrary to some of the reviews  account management has all of the features you could want and more. You can add and delete accounts at will  and you can even switch between them. This app does not seem to be any more useful than the web UI  but I will say the interface has a nice design and is pleasant to use.

Review 4: Might be good So far the most important part of the app... For my use case.... Is instant download and it doesn't work on Android N. That being said N is in Beta so of course I expect to run into these issues... But i also expect that this will be fixed on the first stable N release and I will upgrade my rating at that time.

Review 5: App is good for its intended use I love own cloud  and this app too. There are some missing features yes  but for the most part I can do what I need with the consideration its a mobile app. Would defiantly need some updates but that's what you get with open source apps. Running on property software like android.

Ich finde alles Top bis auf die alles markieren Funktion  aber die kommt sicherlich bald... :)

Review 7: It seems InstantUpload is working again. Thanks! There is one thing I miss in the app: It would be awesome to be able to decide whether InstantUpload should upload images or videos when connected to 3G/4G or edge/2G in addition to WiFi only (like FolderSync from Tacit Dynamics does). Regards

Review 8: Great tool with some kinks It won't upload selected folders automatically  including whatsapp media files like Amazon. Once an account is registered in the app  the only way to remove it is by uninstalling. Overall it's a great app  with some minor nuisances.

Review 9: Does the job Been using owncloud for a couple years and love it. It's not as pretty as the big name cloud services (i.e. Google  apple  microsoft) but eye candy is not the goal  being in control of your data is. Keep it going!

The very first time I tried it I got completely locked out of my phone  no lock screen just my background that was unresponsive to anything I did. Had to battery pull. The check mark unlocks the phone but so does jus making a straight line lol. Obviously not a good screen lock if it does that. Some of the gestures don't work like the capital B for browser. Some random gestures can make other things come up

com.pilot51.voicenotify,Negative,"Review 1: Best TTS so far! I've been using this the day I got my new Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and it has tremendously helped with my language learning instead of reading it all the time! :3 Though I do like it paired with Read Aloud  another awesome tool I have for selecting text and listening to my selection in my target learning language  I do have a few minor issues. For some odd reason  the Notify and Read Aloud apps do not automatically detect the languages I select in Read Aloud and only goes with a default language I set. This means I have to manually set the language I want read  which is very annoying. In addition  the language detection percentage found in Read Aloud does not work at all in my heavy testing. One other problem I have is the headset I plug in my phone used to read the audio stream I set to read aloud doesn't seem to work anymore. When I first downloaded the app a few days ago  it worked even with the head-set on. Now  it tells me """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Screen On"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" highlighted in red as a reason why it did not speak my chosen stream. Sometimes I need to set the device state to only """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Headset On"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" when other people are sleeping or do not want to be disturbed and it doesn't work  period.""""

Review 2: Does pretty much what I want it to  but... The app is very good overall  however it's lacking a few customisations that would take it to the next level. In particular  it would be great to be able to customise the output string on a per application basis so that I can have it say something like 'New message from [contact name]' rather than reading aloud private messages in public. Apart from the privacy concerns  it can be far too verbose. This would also negate the need to start notifications by saying the app name  as you could tell it to say 'New email from...' or '[Name] tweeted...'. UPDATE: Unfortunately I had to uninstall it because it was causing a conflict that prevented 'Ok Google' hotword detection from working on my Nexus 5 (mic in search bar becomes hollow when VN is enabled). Will try it out again if this is fixed.

Review 3: Great! Just please add the option to ignore certain notifications within the same app  currently one can only either ignore the whole app altogether or receive all of its notifications  for example I want to be notified of new WhatsApp messages but that's it  I don't want it to voice notify me that I have copied a message or deleted so many messages  thanks

Review 4: Conflict with Hotword Detection I really don't understand why this isn't already baked into android. It should be an obvious choice for anyone using a hands free kit. Unfortunately I can't use it at the moment as it breaks the even more useful hotword detection on the Google Experience Launcher. Once this is fixed  this will be an immediate download again.

Review 5: Please fix it. Aside from that this app fails to read the entire contents of the message whether that's the stock messaging app or third party like Telegram for example only a few lines are read. Are our credit cards really safe turning this on? Please fix it so the entire text message reads out loud not just the first few words. LG G3 stick ROM 5.1.1.

Review 6: Good app but desperately needs updating!!! Has not kept up with the latest Android versions since Jelly Bean. Where's the support for extended notification text??? This is the reason for many of the comments about notifications from certain apps not being spoken. No response from Pilot_51 to any comments here. App appears to be abandon-ware. Outdated.

Review 7: Still not great It would be so much better if it didn't cancel lots of other features. S-voice no longer has voice output when this is turned on. There are lots of Galaxy features that this disables so I can't use this anymore. * Still s-voice doesn't work worth this. How can I use this and still use S-Voice at the same time?

Review 8: Good enough  but TTS crashes occur frequently and followed by losing my media sound. This happened each time it is trying to read continuous notifications from social networking app such as whatsapp especially numbers of senders. Sometimes  lengthy notifications from Facebook as well. Please fix.

Pros: I have been looking for an app like this ever since I rooted my Gallaxy S2 back in the day and installed Cyanogenmod losing the voice notifications the Samsung built in! I ditched it in favor of a Nexus 5 when it launched. This app works really well and I love all the options! It is heading in a great direction! It is ready for daily use! Cons: As many other reviewers have pointed out the privacy concerns of having your messages read aloud is a bit of a problem. I hope that is addressed in future updates.

Possible Improvements: Having a feature that would read only """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""x"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" amount of characters of the message could cover the privacy issue until it is possible to identify senders.

Also  and this is a little nit picky  it would be nice if it would announce """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""New email"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" instead of just """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Email"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for all messaging/email/chat style apps.""""

Review 2: Excellent and very useful app. Works perfectly. I especially like that you can specify which of your phone's apps VN will speak for. Suggestions/comments: 1) Would be nice if it could also say caller's names. 2) And if the widget changed colour (and shape?) when VN is turned off. ...p.s. Just realised it does seem to change colour but for those of us who are colour-blind  we need a much clearer change please. ...maybe from primary red or yellow when """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""on"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to greyed out when """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""off"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

If I hear (bing)Hangout  I'll read the message right away. 5 stars if I could use regular expressions to create rules  or basic scripting. Ideally I'd like it say (bing)Facebook message from ((sender name)).""""

Review 5: Fantastic app! I highly recommend it! 'Voice Notify' is an essential app for anyone  but especially useful for someone such as myself who has dexterity difficulties  also has a SCI & is a fulltime wheelchair user. I do not have to look at my phone to know what is happening. VN is very customisable  eg  you can stop some FB group messages by putting the group name or a word in the 'ignored text' option in VN settings. Wish 'Email' said who was sending the emails like 'Gmail' does. Unfortunately on my new Note4  VN keeps being 'disabled'!?! Such a pain for an essential app! ?

Review 6: Really good app I only wish I could integrate it with a tasker profile. I'd love for it to automatically enable itself when my existing car mode profile is active and disable when it's no longer active. I looked through the code hoping I could find a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""intent"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I could hook into. Thought maybe I could automate based on the supplied widget but alas  couldn't find a way. Maybe next version add an intent? I know is tasker users would love it. Still very nice app.""""

Review 7: Pretty much flawless  with one exception. It does exactly what it claims  but my only problem is that there's no way to separate bluetooth from headset detection. I want it to speak my notifications while I'm driving (connected to a bluetooth stereo) but not while I'm sitting at my desk with a headset plugged in. Other than that  it works! The interface isn't exactly friendly  but you can figure it out with some trial and error.

Review 8: 2 years on and still lovin it! Very customizable and easy to use. Can enable/disable notifications of practically any app installed. Customize common text phrases such as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""message could not be sent..."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""BUGGER!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" It really helps having adequate Speech to Text engines such as SVOX  IVONA or ACAPELA.""""

Review 9: Love this app!! This is just what I was looking for! No more having to wonder what notifications I have missed  now I can hear everyone  and I never miss one  I hear them all!

Review 2: Great on my phone  not so much on my tablet No issues on my phone but not a great experience on my tablet. It you choose to open links in your browser as default 80% of the app is empty wasted white space and most of the link title is cut off. Too bad I can't force phone mode. Other then that the app would be perfect with a dark mode and a way to quickly refresh/sync.

Review 3: Doesn't work Every time I try to login it tells me my user and PW are invalid. I do have a pinboard account  I changed password thrice because I thought I misspelled it or something  I tested the account from both mobile and laptop -it exists and it has all my bookmarks uploaded. What's wrong with the app? Please help

Review 4: This is a great app  though with the current version for some reason I can no longer sign in on my stock android Nexus 5X device. Entering my credentials simply errors with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""The username or password isn't valid. A Pinboard account is required. Please try again.'""""

Pinboard is the best of that and dead simple. It's like a twitter feed for yourself. I save bookmarks while browsing on desktop computers  tablets and phones.

Review 2: Good with a reservation Downside: tags are not uploaded as hints onto mobile device  but only stored locally as you use them  and the local ones also get lost if the device is switched off  which is very inconvenient if your tags count in the hundreds like mine. Still  the best app for pinboard I've used so far  it has everything else  hence the 4 star rating.

com.plusonelabs.calendar,Negative,"Review 1: Originally used to replace widget on Samsung S series phone when built in widget disappeared. Had difficulty at first since when installing only downloads settings icon but not widget itself. Fooled around with it and suddenly the widget started working on phone. It's a great widget working so well on phone I decided to add it to my Samsung Note Tablet 10. Same issue as before. Installed settings icon but no calendar widget even though settings are set to my default calendar. I can't recall how I got widget itself to appear on phone and I'm hardly a mobile device illiterate. Something is wrong when you create an app that doesn't make obvious how to activate full widget. Uninstalled. Waste of space unless you know how to unlock the magic key to get widget itself to appear on screen. Fortunately old widget still working on tablet although it's not as good as one on phone. Going to get new phone soon and wonder what will happen if I try to install this on new device. Useless without widget! Surely I'm not the only one with this issue and nothing on Github.

Review 2: I like this little widget  but the one thing that I find annoying is that you cannot alter the color that is assigned to your calendar. Currently I'm stuck at red  and the only way I can tell to change that is alter the order you add calendars  but even then the colors that are showing up on the Calendars section are pretty unappealing. I want a gray/black/neutral that I can edit based on my background.........please. Also  I too have had to completely uninstall/reinstall the app several times to get it to update  but have only had to do that a few times - annoying  yes.....but by no means a frequent thing.

Review 3: Nice except for a couple things. But it's also free so.. Needs option to color the actual time and date not just the header and event. Also the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""date format"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" should actually change the 👉date format👈 Example: Wed  May 27  or Wed 5/27. It only gives option for the time (?) That's NOT the date. I'd much rather have display options like Tue  Sept 5  than Tuesday  September 5 which doesn't fit my header. Also no response to feedback ever and no way to leave it on git hub. I see no option to join or leave feedback other than here which they don't read.""""

Review 4: Unwanted reminders Great app and widget  never had any problems until I got a Note 5. At that point any events I add get a reminder automatically put on them. I press the minus button and hit save  thinking that should be it to remove alarms from events. It will save correctly  and no alarm. Then I'll go back and see there's a reminder! Wtf? How does this happen when I'm not even touching my phone or the app? It needs to stop  if I want an alarm on an event  I know how to add one (especially with so much practice of removing)

Review 5: Like it but it wont color code The calendar layout is awesome but I am having a hard time with the fact that all of my calendar events are from the same google account  which only registers as 1 calendar color. I have multiple calendars from that Google account  but it all registers as from Google  not separate calendars. I need the contrasting colors for my brain to comprehend the different events that are happening throughout the week. Is there any way to allow users to choose what color each event shows up as?

Review 6: Not always accurate It was working great  I got a new phone  another Android  and the calendar converts over however since my events carry over to the next day it states the event ends at midnight has a new event on the next day but the time only reads midnight not the time the event ends which is useless as I need to know what time the events end. And I have toggled the settings including the show event end time button.

Review 7: Good  but. . . Nice looks. But still has niggly problems. Deleting an event from the calendar does cause the widget to update itself. Needs to be scrolled down and refreshed for it to work. Deleting the event when there is no network means we have to deselect the calendar and reselect it for that item to go. All this testing was done after adding new items to the """"""""""""""""phone calendar"""""""""""""""".""""

Review 8: Love it. ONE issue. I use this widget for everything. But today it cost me $50 in missed appointment fees because it CHANGED THE TIME of my appointments after the Daylight Savings Time time change this Sunday. It changed every appointment of mine to display an hour LATER than scheduled. The Google calendar event was still correct but the widget was wrong. Fix this IMMEDIATELY  please.

Review 9: One issue preventing me from awarding 5 stars - I'm on the East coast  if that makes a difference  and maybe this only happens when timed events have all ended  but All Day events disappear before the end of the day (11:59pm) on the actual home screen widget. All day events  regardless of what else is or is not on the calendar  should be there actually ALL DAY.

Review 10: There is no alternative The only widget I found which works nicely with S Planner and Nova launcher. All the others are bloated with useless features while this one does exactly what promised - a simple widget that displays your calendar and launches your preferred calendar app when clicking the event. This is exactly what I was missing on Galaxy S.",5359,The app was originally used to replace widget on Samsung S series phone when built in widget disappeared.

Review 3: Brilliant  but.... I love this widget. The only change I would make is that the event exclusion list should allow users to hide events based on exactly the text to be hidden and not that all events with those keywords are excluded. E.g. if I want to hide 'Party at Claires' the filter excludes any item with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""party""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""at"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Claires"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" so would exclude items such as 'party at Johns' or 'leaving party'. Better still : if there was an option to hide individual items then I would have given this 5/5 stars.""""

Review 4: Stylish & minimalistic widget hides within it absolutely perfect functionality! This calendar widget has everything I need  itneven has functions I personally don't need but can understand why others could. The widget itself is minimalistic and stylish with good options for customising the look to you taste. The options and settings part of this little widget is where it's magic lies  the options you get for optimising the widget to suit you are very good and make this the best and most versatile calendar widget I've been able to find!

Review 5: Very nice overall Does exactly what it says on the tin: Shows an agenda view of the days ahead. For my personal tastes  two additions would make this perfect: 1. The option to draw attention to today's events somehow  maybe through highlighting them with a different colour than future events or marking them with a star or something. It's easy to overlook today's events sometimes  even though they're smack dab in front of you. 2. The option to personalize the background of the widget with a personal photo.

Review 6: Thanks man I'm sorry for STEVEN coolers Packer For real good sleep well done in return Readymade to have fun today was thinking maybe it's all rights groups yet another great idea what happened yesterday at my new favorite movies on his first one way out for Tracy herritt helpful very good news search keywords in our homepage share this evening of done with message on getting some people think you someone else's sometimes called for STEVEN Awesome coolers Packer Please send them over there for me.

Review 7: Awesome but room for improvement I love that it shows consecutive days even noon event days  my stock widget didn't do that...the one thing that would make it better is to allow for day/date text color change on days with events  to make 'at a glance' so much easier.....please look into that option...also the horizontal line placement combines the event with the following date making it rather confusing  those lines should be modified and the current date don't bigger or bold

Review 8: Suggestion for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Show days without events"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Samsung recently removed their similar widget in an update and had theirs set up where the current day's event was shown regardless if there were any and then showed the other dates with events. It's simply a preference issue and I think other people would enjoy it as well. I'd imagine it wouldn't be too hard to implement as well. Hope the developers see this.""""

Review 9: Perfect way to see the calendar in a detailed but convenient way It functions perfectly  the customization is nice to fit more information on screen and to avoid the eyesore that some other calendar widgets produce if you have a dark or transparent theme with your launcher. My only suggestion for the developer is to allow the Google now reminders in the calendar feed like the default Google calendar widget does.

Review 10: Great widget I switched to this after the Samsung Google widget disappeared. I really like this one and I love the customization options. I have noticed recently that the dates for all day events are showing as two days. I checked on fill all day events in the event details settings and it resolved the date issue though events that are longer than 1 day show up as several entries.

com.powerpoint45.lucidbrowser,Positive,"Review 1: 5 Stars It's better than a 4 so I give it a 5. I just discovered Lucid and gave it a Test Drive on both my phone and a large tablet like HP Slate. I have tested a bunch of different browsers and this is the first one that works out really great on both devices. Some of the web pages load up a little nicer in desktop mode on my HP than it does using my other go to browser(Dolphin). I can get the fonts big enough using Lucid so a legally blind person could read. User interface  customization  ease of use  etc. is all quite to my liking so far. I will probably be a buyer for the ad free version of this browser. I just did an additional comparison to the Dolphin browser I was using for a few weeks... I played back video on Universal Sports.... Lucid browser played the video smooth and flawless while the Dolphin browser was playing back slowly  stalled and crashed once. My impressions are that this is the better browser. Facebook is a little buggy with the Lucid browser- having trouble clicking to chat and new comments in the top menu bar... that would be the only fault I have found so far.

Review 2: Great for now Everything is working smooth and nice but it would be cool if the fullscreen mode would hide the adress/action bar and keep the status bar and scrolling up (or pressing implemented menu button next to recent apps button) would bring the adress/action bar up. And also if you could improve page scrolling a bit it would be great...the scrolling is smooth but leaves the page white for a second if scrolling very fast...not a huge problem but could be solved i believe. Keep up the good work :)

Review 3: Great yet hot? Amazing browser  everything I could want in an incredibly light package. I'm using it as my main browser but it warms my HTC one up quite a bit after awhile. I thought it was because of the transparency showing my live wallpaper at first but going to a solid color hasn't fixed it. It seems the LW is still being rendered beneath the app anyway  can this be fixed somehow? Also would love to see am auto-hiding URL bar! Great browser though keep up the good work!

Review 4: Fast  lag free  great UI And a really small file size! Could use an adblock addon and text selector could improve. Like the minimalist UI  where I can be really immersed to the content  and the transparent address bar. Text selection works okay at input text boxes  but not so well at other text. Please fix this. Thanks

Review 5: Brilliant Browser I really like this browser and would like to make a suggestion. Is it possible that you could make the home screen wallpaper apparent when opening the browser or clicking home  as an option please? This effect can be currently be achieved by closing all the tabs but keeping the side bar open.

Review 6: Great app The browser is really awesome. There are so many browsers on the market that pack their app so full of unnecessary features for myself  and I find this browser is amazingly minimalistic. I recommend it for anyone that just wants a fast and lightweight browser. Its also open source which is nice.

Review 7: Works very well On Nexus 7 & Moto X both on Android 4.4.4 (ART) works great. One problem is when I come across apps that stupidly put menu items on the app shelf at bottom of screen  the immersive nature of the capacitive buttons in lucid browser makes it difficult to select these items.

Review 8: Small and snappy Great little browser. Basic  light and quick. Only problem I've had so far is that touches used to be really inaccurate. This has suddenly fixed  either due to an update or a newer build of lollipop. This is one the best browsers!

Review 9: Brilliant simple browser This is such a simple  easy to use  light browser which I currently favor over Chrome due to its simplicity. Love how natural it feels to swipe from right to see tabs and menu. Great app!

Review 10: Great Love the easy access to tabs. Could really use a simple adblocker though.

Review 2: I had this awhile back  and it worked  but I ended up getting rid of it. I reinstalled it after getting the lollipop update and now I'm having issues. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4  and like a lot of other people  the app crashes on trying to load a game and returns to the home screen. I did a fresh setup  and it says you're supposed to boot the bios first before loading a game  but even that makes it crash. All the files are correct and stored in the correct folders on the phone's internal memory  not an external SD card  which for some reason isn't accepted. I followed directions to the tee  and the app is just broken. Someone please fix this so I can finally play my games again.

Review 3: What is wrong here.... is it this update? Sooooooo.. i used to have this emulator back then about 2 years ago on a nuqleo tablet that had a rocket chip chipset now  it was working fine despite the occasional crashing. Then i got it again on an lg optimus 2x with more or less of the same problems but i could still load up the games. But now  present day  with an asus memo pad 8 with intel inside for a cpu and gpu but now it if i try to load up a game or the bios (to get into dreamcast menu screen) it just crashes instantly sooooooo.... what the heck  is it this device or this update.... ok thanks.

NVIDIA SHIELD USER

Review 9: Surprisingly smooth! But don't exit... It does skip often but never to the point where it's unplayable and the sound never skips. One big complaint is that if I press the home or multitasking buttons on my phone by accident  the game will be closed once you go back into the app  which is devastating when you haven't saved. I also wish you could set the rendered resolution to be the original native resolution from DC  rather than my device's. Finally I would like a circular analog touchpad rather than square  and autosaving when exiting the game.

Review 10: Poor quality and not for the faint of heart The only available dream cast emulator and it seems as though the only way to get it to work is to enter some dark pact. I get that they cannot off the bios but it'd be nice if they had a folder already created with the correct places for the bios so I don't have to do all the leg work (apps are supposed to make life easy). Couldn't get it running at all. I got it to recognise the bios but it would crash immediately.

com.reicast.emulator,Positive,"Review 1: Almost 5 stars This is a great app  especially considering the fact it's emulating the Dreamcast and fairly new. There are 2 things that stop me from giving it that extra star  and it's only because I'm spoilt from ePSxe. 1. Exiting the app via the Home button quits the game without warning. Every once in awhile I'll accidentally hit it (or hit it on purpose  forgetting it doesn't work the same way ePSxe does)  losing a ton of progress. (In case anyone doesn't know how ePSxe works  it remembers the state the game was in after you leave the app  allowing you to restore the game the next time you come back.) 2. Save states. This is mainly only a problem because of the first one. With ePSxe I had 3 options if I wanted to take a break or do something else quickly on my phone. Find a save point (not as easy in most games)  save states or close the game and restore it later  keeping my progress. With Reicast my only option is to find a save point  which are scarce. Unlike the actual consoles these emulators emulate  there's usually countless times you have to urgently close the app due to phone calls or text messages. It's still a really great app and definitely worth getting  though.

Review 2: I'm pretty amazed at this emulator.. I really wasn't holding out much hope... but I can now play Dreamcast games on my phone! Only tested a few titles - Virtua Tennis 1 & 2 and Resident Evil Code Veronica... there are a couple of glitches on the tennis games but they're totally full-speed and completely playable.. and I'm blown away at how well Code Veronica (one of my favourite games) works. Would love to see this emulator improved with a slightly better UI and some extras like Save States. Also I had some problems with the touch-screen controls (they were slightly off) but I use a bluetooth controller anyway as touch-screen is awful (8BitDo Nes30 Pro) and that works great with this emulator. All in all SO impressed and hope this gets some good support - I would definitely pay for this emulator if it meant that more improvements were made... 5 Stars if the UI fixes and save states are implemented.

Review 3: Greetings! So  the other day i was playing Capcom vs SNK 2 (J) Gameplay is good and the speed is also good but the only problem would be that The sprites aren't proper. Like  it shows broken sprites. I really hope you fix that asap~ Cus i used to play this game when i was a child and like  it brings back so many memories. Hope you can fix that Issue and if you could notify me after fixing it  that would be just great. I have the Bios. I have the Iso. Now just need a bit more to make it perfect. Hoping for a suitable reply. Works well in the menus  and the speed in-game is reasonable  but the characters in 2D are completely glitchy and it makes it unplayable at this stage. Sound stutters too once in a while. But the sound problem is alright lol since I listen to music instead and i turn off the sound from the emulator. Please fix that :'(

Review 4: Near perfect This works great. I get my ROMs from coolrom and they work fine. With testing  I cannot use the PAL version crazy taxi 1 when I select 60Hz or 50Hz but crazy taxi worked on older versions. Soul caliber also has some graphic issues  but nothing to make it unplayable. And shenmue 1 disk 1 worked fine  but then the game could not find my save  even though it was still on the memory card when I booted the bios. Also  Sonic Adventure 1 has widescreen issues on the nexus 2012  i don't know about other games. The cdi format seems to work fine  i don't know why you discourage it. It is super simple to setup  I was able to figure it out without even looking it up. That's all I found so far using a Google nexus 7 2012. Using a galaxy tab s 8.4  Sonic Adventure worked fine  even in widescreen mode. I have not tested any other game.

Review 5: (EDIT) I've been doing it wrong the whole time and the game's rom was zipped and I didn't realise it. Now my game runs perfectly smooth and it's amazing! It brings me nice memories of me playing against the clock with my cousins on sonic adventure 2. We used to finish the whole game in about 3 hours  we had so much fun. Now I can play all of my dreamcast games. Thank you so much!!! P.D It does take some time to set it up though  just look through some forums and you'll be alright. (OLD REVIEW) I've been two hours searching through forums  downloading files  creating folders and followed every single instruction but yet I can't get my games running because of the stupid bios files. I keep getting an error and the links on the app's description don't even work. Meh  I guess I'll have to use another emulator.

Review 6: This Emulator Is For You! Reicast runs perfect on a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""nexus 7 Wi-Fi"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (haven't tried other devices) you just have to set your settings to give the best performance for your device. I really hope an action replay or some other cheat device is implemented soon. Controls are easy to use  and the video quality is amazing. I recommend this app to anyone who wants to play DC games with little problems.(I really hope a cheat system is added soon...)(could use a save state as well and an update to keep the date and settings from resetting every time I reset the emulator) """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I rate this a 5* Emulator even if there are not as many options as other emulators """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""yet""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Review 7: way way better than expected  and totally real A bit of futzing around with folders to get it to recognize both the flash and the bios (Whavever ones you download  you have to rename them to EXACTLY """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""dc_bios.bin"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""dc_flash.bin""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  no other filename will work) but after that  it runs Sonic Adventure really well out of the gate. Framerate is not perfect  it will start chugging at certain points  and the textures are buggy in many places  but it's entirely playable and actually runs much better than any DC emu I've tried on my PC. If the dev keeps updating and making it better  this looks like a soon-to-be must have app.""""

Review 8: Great work! I have a Nexus 7 (2013). The most popular games that will most likely be played are :Shenmue  Skies of Arcadia  Grandia II  Phantasy Star Online  and Sonic. Other games like Soul Caliber don't really work with tablet controls unless you are a controller. Anyway. Shenmue works great. Grandia II is flawless. Sonic lags a good bit with my nexus. But Skies of Arcadia does not work with the newest build. Maybe it's my rom  but I've tried two  and no dice. Though the creator said he will try and fix it for the next update. But Shenmue  Phantasy  and Grandia work perfectly. It's an amazing free app that's well on it's way. Thus the 5 stars.

Review 9: Tested on Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 and running fine with Crazy Taxi 2. Controller support is a must though and hopefully you'll implement it in a future update. I'd even pay for it as it's such a good emulator. Keep up the good work. It's working on Smart Ultra 6 too. If it doesn't work on your device (Intel processor maybe?) just download a version from the website as that may work. UPDATE: Using a Moga Power controller and for some reason I can't get L and R to work. They're assigned correctly in settings and they worked on an older device I had but not on my current one. It renders Crazy Taxi 2 unplayable.

Review 10: It was a bit hard to get this thing working but now it works and it works great barely any glitches when I play SA2 (besides the screen's sides flickering and that there are no shadows which makes it a bit tricky when it comes to defeat King Boom Boo). Now if only I can get Sonic Adventure 1........ Edit: YES I FINALLY HAVE SA1 AND SA2 MY LIFE IS FINALLY COMPLETE! Thanks to the great people/team who made it possible to play the games we couldn't play before or didn't played them yet/kr in a while or just missed the games so much on this great emulator of an even greater console the Sega Dreamcast! :D",8046,EPSxe is a great app especially considering the fact it's emulating the Dreamcast and fairly new. Exiting the app via the Home button quits the game without warning. The characters in 2D are completely glitchy and it makes it unplayable at this stage.
com.ringdroid,Negative,"Review 1: what happened!?! Don't install! Like most other reviews this used to be my go to ringtone app  but when I downloaded it this time it's new update makes it impossible to use! It plays the music in what sounds like slow motion  ok I figured it helps figure out which areas to stop and cut better. Then it wouldn't save the new ringtone/notifications  and when I finally got one to save  it would play back in that slow motion...terrible sound but it never actually worked when I got messaged or called...now it's just a waste of storage...

Review 2: SLEEZY SCUM BAGS! Tried to delete ringdroid to free up space  because I never even used a single thing on the app ever. When deleted ringdroid leaves you a present  it disables all ringers  and notifications so you don't know when u receive phone calls  emails  and texts. Trying to turn the sounds back on reveals that those entire sections are all greyed out meaning it will not allow u to turn anything back on again and fix the problem. The only fix I found was I was forced to download it again and it restores everything.

Review 3: I have used this app for years but as I read I'm not the only one having problems. When I download a song it will download maybe 50% & when I play the song it's n slow motion. I've tried 2 different songs. Both have not been full song & have both been in slow motion. I downloaded 3 songs all together. The 1st song did fine until I tried setting it as a notification & it wouldn't let me but instead it automatically became a default ringtone when someone called. I can't believe how it's working. It just sucks

Review 4: After update Wow after the update got into the app and found all sorts of ringtones listed thought they were loaded junk started deleting till I figured out they were from my own phone like camara clicks and so forth luckily I did not delete something super important. I don't like scrolling through all the nonsence before getting to my music then when I do takes a long time to load. Gets stuck once it passes 98. Please fix and ill adjust rating.

Review 5: Totally unusable! I've been using Ringdroid for a considerable time and have never had a problem with it until recently. This program has become literally unusable. The files take way too long to load  and most eventually error out anyways. Then there's the fact that every time you try to use the search feature  the program stops working. Unacceptable  and now there's better products out there. Goodbye  you won't be missed  Ringdroid.

Review 6: Need bugs fix I used to use this app on my s6 edge for make ringtones from my music saved in my phone. I have not use it in a while but I just wanted to make a couple of new ring tones and I can not even make one due to not sounding right  it seems like the numbers at the top of the app is all smashed together. So please fix these issues and then i rate perfect because it was just fine before.

Review 7: Ringdroid/ringdroid team This app is thrash. I had 2 record notifications 3 times 1. I saved dem in my notification file  but when I selected dem they all beeped (no music) 2. I recorded some more & saved dem as notifications  next day dey were gone. 3 Recorded again  same results. I emailed da developer but dey don't hav a support team  so I uninstalled it.

Review 8: Music isn't on the app I downloaded this app in hope that i would be able to customize my ringtones  but when I opened it  none of my music was on there. Only the ringtones that came with my phone showed up under the app and that doesn't help me at all. From what I can tell  the editing tools look fine  its just that I CANT EDIT MY MUSIC IF ITS NOT THERE

Review 9: What once was perfect.. ..is currently experiencing too many to justify keeping installed. Don't get me wrong  this app was marvelous  it really tussled by muffet  but now it crashes when you search  doesn't save file properly and fails at setting ringtone. Alas  now I must search elsewhere for an app to do what I could easily do in 10 seconds on a pc.

Review 10: What happend!!!!! I've been using this app for a while and ever since the update it's gone downhill....I have old and new music downloaded on my S6 edge plus and just about all of them download halfway and playback in slow motion. I've uninstalled the twice and it still does it. This really needs to be fixed asap until then I'm getting rid of it 😢",4397,"Ringdroid is a ringtone app for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.

com.ringdroid,Positive,"Review 1: This App is handy for recording  music organizing  creating ringtones  and notifications. This app is very intuitive. I just have two suggestions that would make this app near perfect  & that's Bluetooth or any kind of Audio transferring  and utilization of cloud drives. I have multiple devices  and having the ability to obtain my audio files on all of my devices would be very useful.. Great App though.. btw I don't give 5 stars eve  due to no app in the history of apps is perfect.. oh 1 more thing  it'd be nice if it was easy to locate this apps file location.

Review 2: Ringdroid performance Well to say as much as possible without chatting it up  I've been downloading music from my phone since I was 12 years old  and texting was just becoming a normal thing. With that said I'm now 28 years of age and this was the first ringtone making app I ever downloaded  and I haven't changed since! Over 15 years of me using this particular app  and I've yet to run into a problem! This is by far the best application hands down! I would Highly recommend it  you get to use all of your own material!❤💙💚💛💜👌✊

Review 3: Works perfectly! I wanted the option to have no sound (silent) for a particular contact in Signal (which I *love* & highly recommend). The app allows you to customize notifications per contact/thread - cool! However  it does not provide the option of 'silent' under the notification sounds. It does provide that option under notification sounds for the overall default notification sound for the app  just not for a particular contact. I used Ringdroid to save a silent part of one ringtone to a new file and voila!  it worked!

Review 4: !!!THE BEST!!! I would recommend this app to everybody ringtone Maker is f**ken awesome for all needs... I've had it ever since they came out with it..try it you won't be disappointed remember always turn your unit off & on!!! & I would like to get the full version of it!! Or it doesn't matter??? So please respond to me whenever you get a chance guys or gals thanx!!! Easy fix issues turn your unit off & on then app might respond better... if not uninstall then reinstall it!!! & if that doesn't work...then u have a BUG!!

Review 5: Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 I've been using this app more or less since android phones 1st came out & it has been a big help in helping me set tones on my phone the way I want it. But the last update has made the app faulty. I can cut the corus out of a song to use & there's no problem  but if I try to cut short a spoken ring tone  it sounds as if it was recorded in a device with the batteries going flat. Before I could use this app on all music & tones (except protected stuff) with no problem.

Review 6: Incredible! I have been using this app since 2010 when I first got my brand new Original Motorola Droid. It has never failed me. Ever. Works like a dream. I can cut the exact part of the song I want for my ringtone. Most ringtone apps give only the chorus but this app allows you to use that one line that means the most to you  or your favorite verse of that song that you love to dance to. There's no other app out there that works so perfectly. Love it. Download it. Now.

Review 7: Wma? Besides the fact that I can make kick ass ring tones from wma files  which socks because that's what most of my music is and I don't want to go back and fix it all through the computer. Other than that I love this app is can make my own personal ring tone and alarm tone for when I wake up  assign them to what ever contact i want  and unlike my stupid windows phone I had I can actually listen to the whole text tone and not 5 seconds of it great app  add wma please

Review 8: Works well and highly recommended! I went searching for an application to make alert tones after I used such an application on my Palm Centro... And this is the perfect solution! It's awesome to see that Ogg Vorbis files are now supported  as virtually all of my (mobile device) music is encoded in this format. With an easy-to-use interface  this simple-but-powerful application is highly recommended for anyone wishing to create their own  personalized alert tones!

Review 9: I think this app is brilliant because it's so easy to use and it allows you to change the boring built in ringtones to something louder and more personal to the user. The reason I needed this app is because I recently bought a Moto E 3rd generation and couldn't find a way to personalise the ringtones or notifications which really annoyed me seeing as I paid 100 notes for it but this app sorted that out in no time. Thanks to the developers!!!

Review 10: What happened to this app? Used to work great  loved it... but now everytime I hit the search the app closes... and when I have to scroll to find a song ( because I can't use the search or it closes ) the song doesn't download fully. Maybe I'll just uninstall it and reinstall it and see if that fixes the problem. If not I guess I'm just going to get rid of it. Ok...looks like that fixed the problem...the app is back to being awesome again😁",5060,Ringdroid was the first ringtone making app I ever downloaded and I haven't changed since.

com.roguetemple.hyperroid,Negative,"Review 1: Too easy to die... ... Even for a roguelike. I play a lot of dcss and so I do understand that roguelikes are by their very nature quite unforgiving  but even so  i think this takes that danger of death a little too far. You  in effect  start off with 1hp  so when you're accosted by more than one enemy your toast  instantly! I really think you need to start with more than a single  solitary hp to make people want to keep trying better themselves. Instant  unforgiving death is no fun.

Review 2: Nice roguelike but it's very annoying that the app has to keep running in the background or you lose your progress. We should be able to pick up and put down whenever!

com.roguetemple.hyperroid,Positive,"Review 1: It's great! Bought it on PC  it runs better there. Anyone complaining about the lack of saving  you have to pick up an orb of safety and it'll reset the world but not progress or type of land you're in. After that  when it's still active for seven or so turns  you can save and quit and kill the app. That orb is in the Land of Eternal Motion and saving is it's sole purpose.

Review 2: Mind bogglingly cool roguelike. The spatial distortion has some really profound and subtle impacts on strategy  especially when running away or jockeying for battle position. Playing this for just a few days has been enough to give me non-euclidian nightmares.

Review 3: Very interesting and engaging I love the concept. I'm just not very good at the game and so do not progress as much as I would like to. I think I would do better were I to use a game pad.

Review 4: Save feature? A really clever and unique game  which I would buy & play continually if I didn't have to start over from 0 every time. Keep working on this  dev!

Review 2: Low quality of single pictures I changed layout to one picture in hope of finding a wallpaper that would change every now and then with the possibility of changing by tapping the background.

Review 2: Waiting is the hardest part... Even when we're into forced moves  it takes forever. Give the AI a surrender option. The game's already over and I'm waiting for 10 minutes for each of the AI's pointless remaining moves. Very frustrating.

Review 3: Good concept But the ai is way too slow  especially on larger boards. The ai is too weak on medium difficulty  it let me win easily by making a few stupid moves. So  it is a good start but needs polish to become actually playable

Review 4: Computer Slow On 11x11 hard  the computer takes upwards of 2 minutes to make a single move. 21 minutes to beat the computer is utterly ridiculous.

com.sam.hex,Positive,"Review 1: Great game with a few app problems The game is actually fantastic  however  I have been running into some issues since the UI update (sometime around summer 2013). Leaving the game and going back to it will often cause the app to open up as just a white screen. Going back from that to the home screen will (after a few times) eventually cause the app to close and be able to be re-opened to the start screen with the game lost. I'm still glad to have the app on android  and everything is great when the error does not happen  but it does end up being pretty crippling when it does.

Review 2: Exactly what I was looking for: 5 stars I've enjoyed playing this as a board game for many years  and I've always wanted to find a mobile version to play with friends. The only other version I found was fine  but only offered up to a 9 by 9 board. You could  however  pay $2.00 to play on up to 13 by 13  which was pretty reasonable. This version  on the other hand  offers plenty of settings  such as timed games  online play  a simple computer opponent  and a board size anywhere from 4 by 4 to 30 by 30  and it's free to boot. Perfect score.

Review 3: Such a fun game This turned me on to the game as a whole and even though the AI is incredibly slow at larger boards  it's a fun game to kill some time with at the slightly smaller board sizes. PS  it's really hard at first. Read some tips/tutorials online if you've never played before.

Review 4: Fun fun! Game play seems good  AI think times are nigh unbearable  even with the shortest timer selected. Only reason it's 4/5 is the long wait time between it's moves; other than that  absolutely top-notch and is a favorite!

Review 5: Great game This came up in an algorithms class as an NP Complete problem. And while the creators seem to have taken a greedy approach and got stuck in a single matroid since initial steps  its still really fun to play

Review 6: AI too good I love this game for playing against other people  but I try to play against the AI and on medium difficulty it's basically imposible to beat. On easy  it's way to easy. Good game overall though!

Review 7: Great UI. Needs multiplayer improvements. Needs a non-realtime multiplayer mode. Ratings and a leaderboard would be awesome. Can't find option to change the board size for multiplayer games.

Review 8: Slow on big boards I like it. Could do with the red and blue colours along the entire edges as per the instructions  and an audible click when the computer plays might also be helpful.

Within the app  he tells you to click on the HD above  and it sends you to the app store to purchase the HD one. I hate all the Advertisement; which I am sure anyone would agree. This apps has a grip of advertisement. You do not have to believe me. Just download it and see for yourself. I would give the app (3 Stars)  but with all that going on  it gets a one.

Review 3: Doesn't work anymore First the moons went white  then the planets went white  and now i only get a black screen  but the app says everything is fine. I don't know what to do. Update: bugs fixed themselves  but now the planets fail to show up  and I just get words on a background. Update: Crashes. Who ever heard of a wallpaper that crashes?

I don't understand as I have plenty of space and my phone runs very fast. I'm going to uninstall unless this is either fixed fast or I get an explanation.

Review 6: Could be a 5-star  but it's crashed twice now - the only solution was to uninstall and re-install. Also  some of the settings have gotten corrupted  where the map for Earth is being projected as the background. Or when I had the Earth selected  it was mapping the Moon (I believe) as the planet. In theory  a great product. Just gotta hammer out the bugs.

Review 7: Screw this! Ads popping up everywhere in the settings menu  rendering setting up the wallpaper impossible... and one of them wouldn't close  forcing me to reboot my tablet. No chance in hell I'll buy the pro version to get rid of ads; this is an untrustworthy app and somewhat questionable business practice. Couldn't wait to uninstall this one.

Review 2: SUPER Awesome Live Wallpaper! The options and settings for this live wallpaper are literally endless. Dozens of different planets  positions on the screen for the planets  moon present or not present  axis tilt  night/day options  light intensity  cloud movement on the Earth  backgrounds  etc.  etc.  etc. I could tinker with this wallpaper for hours and hours and never see the same scenario twice. It is easy to access and change and it even has a random setting to where you see a different scenario on each wake-up. Awesome  awesome app!

Review 3: It's awesome AND it's free! This is an awesome wallpaper! It has more options  more settings  more scenes than all the other wallpapers COMBINED! Excellent graphics too! I have NEVER given a 5-star +1 before  but I did this time! 4 u ppl who say cant fnd launch icon  lrn how ur fone wrks-that is ur prob. 4 u tht say 2 mny ads: ads r only on config scrn-vry nice of authr 2 do ths n a free app. 4 u tht say moon/Earth/etc are not n exact rite place-its wallpaper not an intergalactic map. If ur traveling 2 Mars  don't use this 2 navigate!

Review 4: I love it! What's an iPhone? The best and most interesting live wallpaper on the android market. Unbelievable that it's for free. The 'real time earth and clouds' map is my one and only wallpaper. I love it so much ;-) Thanks for making this great live wallpaper free! Now I have a new phone (HTC One M9) and it always crashes after a while running. I'd give the HD version a try  but cannot find it...

Review 5: Love outer space stuff! I'll tell you what. Anything related to Astronomy I will just like it. I don't care if it takes lot of battery drain. Love the views of galaxy and interplanetary systems. Other Thoughts : I don't use this wallpaper. I am going to change to having gods background on my phone. Gives me more strength and makes me a believer.

Review 6: Love it Go to the setting and play around with it for a few minutes and figure out all the stuff you can do  I also love how there's so many planets my favorite is 'The Globetroter Home World' my only probelm is I wish I could change the back ground to some cool nebulas or galaxys or somthing but thats no big deal 5?'s Legalize marijuana

Review 7: This app brings me back The first live wallpaper I ever had for an android phone. Looks dated now  but I still remember how cool it looked when it first came out. One of the first 3D space live wallpapers. There are better ones out there now  but 5 stars for the memories of phones past.

Review 8: Beautiful and fun. It can show accurate cloud positions all over the globe. Sometimes it gets night and day reversed  and I need to restart my phone to get them right again  and once had to uninstall and then reinstall it to do that  hence the loss of a star.

Review 9: The most for free I'm extremely impressed with this one. You get a lot for free. More than any other wallpaper I've seen. Its settings can get complex and its live running in background is a little buggy. For me  this wallpaper is the best there is. 5stars

Review 10: Very specific  one can handle quite alot of actions from size to looks/backgrounds but too many ads are hectic as they won't stop. Will see how much of my battery is being consumed  will keep you all posted. If there are less ads  5 🌟 ! Rest is amazing.",3889,"The 'com.seb.SLWP' app is a free live wallpaper for the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. The app has more options and settings than any other live wallpaper on the market.

Review 8: Great app One can make his own prediction of rainfall with this app. However there seems to be an error in arrow direction shown in wind direction plot. It should be opposite to what is shown.

com.shahul3d.indiasatelliteweather,Positive,"Review 1: Very Very Useful App... Great job  but this statistics are not easy to understand for we the common man for example what is infrared is suppose to say and and so does heat map and colour composite. (and I think this app is to help common people like us not the experts) so pls describe the parameters and it's relation with rain in simple language. And please add area wise humidity percentage. And can Also add area wise rain predictions in simple words to make this useful app more useful. You guys doing a great job  thanks...

Review 2: Infrared image and satellite image have a slight difference in Indian country border lines  especially Saurashtra peninsula in Gujarat  which I watch for cloud movements and ganeral weather. I think and hope that the infrared images are more correct.. Otherwise the app is very useful for lay weather watchers.. Very useful visuality very helpful.. needs improvement in wind directions.. arrows indicating wind direction are doubtful.. Helpful to layman...esp for monsoon monitoring.

Review 3: Very useful Would be more than very useful if we could learn how we can combine the various charts to know what to expect next. Please can the developer suggest some references for that? For instance  it'd be good to know why the cloud patterns seem to vary slightly between the infra red and the satellite picture. Also  please could we have the boundaries of the land mass depicted in a contrasting colour to easily differentiate between land and water?

Review 4: Delivers the functionality; needs changes to colors Land boundaries to use a different color tone. Tough to differentiate between land and weather elements easily. Cities need to be given a different t color tone too. This app meets the expectations bang on. In spite of the minor color tone related issues  this is a 5 star app all the way. I used this app a lot during Chennai floods 2015. This app gave one hell of a nightmare !!

Review 5: Very useful but need additional things. I am using this app in travelling in Monsoon. It gives clear vision and sense of generic possible rainfall. This app needs some improvement s like only thick layers of cloud covered but the last layer which seems to be gray from infrared camera which need to be detailed heat and colour maps colour catalog clearly nothing provided. Outline of India sometimes not visible

Review 6: Excellent  just what is required and without any fuss. With the update  it just got better. Autoupdates the pictures  so just open app and the latest satellite capture the clouds overhead is ready. The temperature update feature added is also very nice. Your app has improved performance substantially. Please add a basic forecast guideline to understand maps in the help section

Review 7: Using this I can predict weather better than Met Dept So much info we can get over public access for free. Thanks for the development team for keeping it simple. It would have been better if I could see hourly images of each type  prediction would have been more accurate by looking at the trend of cloud movement  temperature change and wind direction & speed change.

Review 8: Rainfall map is not upgrading I checked it for the first time 2 days ago. But the map is not updated after that. So  it will be nice to have 3 options. 1) add that there is no updates after this time 2)let store the old maps and let play it to see the movements 3) let us save the maps based on timings choosed by us. Other than that  i love it.

Review 9: Good App..... App is reasonably ok  but it should have some explanation with respect to the Weather map . This will be easier for the common man to understand the map better. It is also useful if you have city specific info. Like  now the city of Chennai is experiencing unprecedented rainfall and flood these info will be helpful

Review 10: Crisp Satellite weather view Does what it's supposed to do. Pretty happy with the app so far. However I am never satisfied. So here is a suggestion. It would be amazing if there was animation of the different maps (clouds/ultra violet/heat/wind) as a forecast for the next few days. Just like how they show in weather reports.",4177,Reviews:  Use bullets to highlight the Positive aspects of the app. Summarize the following reviews about the app 'com.shahul3d.indiasatelliteweather' into a concise paragraph.
com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon,Negative,"Review 1: I love the game and all of its mechanics! I have some requests though it may just be because I suck: 1) I think more balancing is needed regarding the chances of what kind of glyph you will get from an arcane stylus. I just get the ones that root or slow the player too often. 2) Vampire bats seem to take rather high amount of health from me and seem to dodge too well too. I don't know  it seems unfair and gets on my nerves. 3) The sniper doesn't have nearly as many advantages compared to the warden  and the assassin to the freerunner. 4) Health potions and food are rarer to come upon. Especially approaching boss level depths. 5) I think access to rings need to be improved. I have frequent games where I do not come across an artefact or other item to fill my other 2 equip slots. And the variety of ring functionality can really change one game from another  if only they weren't so rare. 6) Please nerf the skeleton blasts  in most cases there aren't any means to kill them at a distance and their blasts are rather high for a low level player in my opinion.

Review 2: Updates. I am uninstalling the game right now because of three primer reasons. For the first  any input I've given has been ignored or disregarded. As someone who has cleared shattered and plays it for fun  I feel like the development of this game sucks. For two  the updates just seem to have gone downhill  and that each version prior was more fun to play than the last. For three  I looked at this game as an upgrade from standard pixel dungeon. However  now I think I should uninstall and remove this now falling downhill app from my game. I think with the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""balancing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" updates now the original game would be easier than this senseless RNG (24 weapons!) drivel. I would like the option to remove the updates  use prior versions  or have all the nonsense removed. Untill then  I am uninstalling. I doubt you will read this  it will probably go as unnoticed as the last review I wrote...""""

Review 3: 0.4.1 broke the game - rating accordingly The previous update already had the balance doing a clumsy routine on a tightrope  while this one completely broke the game. Armor is now basically useless  with the first boss consistently doing 12+ damage in one hit through a leather+1 armor. Rats and flies can tear you to pieces since it's not uncommon to roll 0 in armor - the odds are very much against the player. The game is pretty much unplayable unless you luck into +3 armor from the sad ghost or something early game. Wish I could roll back to 0.4

Review 4: The game is still unbalenced Some games you don't have a chance others just die before the first boss. You have to relearn what each potion and scroll does each playthrough. I have never seen the 4th floor boss cause the difficulty ramp on the 4th level is so high I just run out of potions/fall through the floor and die. Don't play until they fix this. I am just tired of this game. I wish getting some achievements gave some sort of percentage boost in don't feel rewarded for the work. Like 10%more gold  +1 luck  +1 strength  +1-0 armor

Review 5: Gladiator isn't useful The gladiator sucks if you have a fast hitting low damage weapon I'm using the sai weapons and I hit 3 times per turn if I miss 2 times the combo is lost but I can move 3 turns before it's lost its annoying that it's so hard to get a combo up because just missing 2 times it's all gone and even with a combo it's not worth it when I have the 10 combo ability the most it hits is 2 or 3 and every other time it does no damage at all a lot of the time using the 10 combo ability does less than just hitting them

Review 6: About the tome Why.Just.Why.This was supposed to be the best PD mod.But after the tome rework i got bored of repeating the first few levels.The tome was meant to be a milestone a reward for all the torments the early game caused.It gave me a sense of happiness when i brought back a book that i got after hours of hardships.But this time...why.Why is it removed??Going for subclasses early will make you plan ahead for your gameplay.Just.Why.Pls bring it back sir :( at least give us a permanent reward for beating bosses

Review 7: Amazing but Flawed I love PD  but Shattered blows that and all the other mods out of the water. It's a ton of fun and totally addicting. However  there is one thing that I cannot stand...after playing hundreds of runs and making it to the final boss only once it seems apparent that the game beats you 9 times out of 10 before you even start. I wish there was a better balance of items (especially for melee characters...) so that you didn't have to choose to quit even when you get far enough in. Ugh here I go again...

Review 8: Having an issue I have been playing shattered pixel dungeon since it's inception. After a few months  I donated. Worth every penny. My issue is that since the newest update  after I kill a monster  the game thinks; freezing the game. But it's not totally frozen. I just can't move. It's like when you hold the button to rest. I can go to the menus  but I can't move and the circle is there near the upper left area below my picture. I have to leave the game and come back in  but the next monster I kill does it again.

Review 9: I love this game but.. I really like this game  but I don't really like how since you don't start with the mastery tome anymore it feels to difficult to progress... I want to keep playing the game but the fact that every run is ENTIRELY up to chance  the fact that I no longer have anything to unlock to help me get back to the later levels leaves me bored quickly. I understand where your coming at when you took away the ability to start with mastery tomes really made an obvious halt on overall game progression.

Review 10: I guess i loved the old design much more  seeing how it looked more refined as compared to the original PD  and it gave SPD an identity I fell in love with. The search button is annoying as I prefer to have 2 separate search buttons like before. I know that might interfere with the 4 items slot  so why not group the 4 quick slots in a square for convenience? One handed function would be improved by this too. Lastly the wand auto targeting sucks. I can't do my long shots that hit corners anymore :(",6307,Shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon is a free-to-play mobile game.

com.shatteredpixel.shatteredpixeldungeon,Positive,"Review 1: I personally love it. There are some bugs like the """"""""""""""""move forever freeze"""""""""""""""" glitch that happens sometimes after fighting an enemy which can be simply fixed by reseting the game. This is the best version of Pixel Dungeon by far and I play it almost every day. Beat it once with the huntress and got close with the warrior. Love the weapon variety too. You should add even more stuff into or even make a whole new sequel to Shattered Pixel Dungeon with the old characters and maybe like 2 new characters. Oh this is just me  but I think the characters you beat the game on should be able to automatically get the object to give them their personal outfits in the beggining for new games. The object you get after the dwarf king boss fight.""""

Review 2: Been playing this game for ages an still love it. The new graphics look great! I think that a good addition would be to have a garunteed rare item (e.g. ring  wand  chalice  scrollbook  decent weapon/armour etc.) on the first couple of floors  because then it would be easier to progress past goo and the prison would be more manegable (because that is where you get the rare stuff in my expirence). In my expierence  the sewers were the hardest because rarely ever got good stuff and once you got to the prison  and got a good item  it was more manegable  so a garunteed rare item to get you there would be good.

Review 3: Addictive  challenging  BEST mobile replay value I love playing this between whatever other game comes out. Although I would NOT say they add content """"""""""""""""roughly"""""""""""""""" every month  they are starting to catch up to """"""""""""""""Sprouted"""""""""""""""" PD. I would love for the dew system from """"""""""""""""Sprouted"""""""""""""""" PD to come to this version  then it would be better! ;) (*update11/26/2016*) this last update must have included a difficulty spike. I never have a problem getting to level 11. Now I rage to make it past 5  if I even make it there. A save function NEEDS TO be included in this version. NEEDS.""""

Review 4: 200+ hours played  loved the variety with all subclasses and weapon/spell archetypes. Better than any PC roguelikes I've seen. Superb work. Just one suggestion: the wands of transfusion and regrowth feel like they probably shouldn't be in the game. I understand their uselessness adds excitement to getting the other wands by contrast  but if they can be reworked into wands that are actually useful even in niche cases it'd probably improve game quality overall. I love having to adapt based on what I'm given  but transfusion and regrowth feel like dead draws. Thanks for the great game!

Review 5: Very awesome roguelike  but I encountered a little problem. Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a vast improvement over the original Pixel Dungeon formula. It has got rebalanced features and quality of life improvements. I have played SPD for quite some time  having played around 120 times already.Out of these tries I had won the game 5 times. I still keep coming back to check new features like class reworks and addition of new weapons + items. Strange  but latest update got an error which doesn't show details of old playtroughs. A mild discomfort that I hope can be fixed.

Review 6: I've been with Pixel Dungeon for a long  long time  and all of my friends know that Shattered is my all-time favorite. Though the gameplay remains the same in the last update  I can't help but feel that something has been taken away from the game by switching the art style to a more 3D build. I know I don't speak for everyone  but I know that I would like the option to toggle between different graphics  just so that players can choose which mode they prefer. Other than that  thank you for your time  and keep doing beautiful things with this beautiful game.

Review 7: Favorite Mobile Game The Original Pixel Dungeon has long been my favorite game on my cell. Shattered Pixel Dungeon has since surpassed the original game  however. For those of you looking for a fresh Pixel Dungeon experience  this one is simply the best. (There are many to choose from.) For those of you who are new to Pixel Dungeon: This game's charm lies in its misleading simplicity. You will die. A lot. Those who enjoy learning from their mistakes in video games will enjoy this thoroughly. I cannot recommend this game enough

Review 8: Great game I've played this game hundreds of times. What I do find ironic though  is whatever class you play  anything that would be useful to that class does not drop. For example. I like to play the mage but wands almost never dropped. Whereas  I play The Warrior  and four wands drop by the time I hit the eight level. It's just not one or two times I've played. I played hundreds of times on all characters. It's a great game  very hard  and I love to play it. But it seems the drop rate for that class is horrible.

Review 9: Great game + great developer I love-love-love this game  but the fact the developer fixed a bug in less than 24 hours is amazing. I assume he has a day job outside of managing this app  but he still fixed it ASAP. A good game is one thing  but a good  totally free game that has very minimal downtime and quick issue resolution is truly great. Also a big fan of the regular upgrades\tweaks to improve it incrementally and how frequently the dev will listen to the players and have a dialog about tips  and new ideas.

Review 10: Overall  this is a great game. I have sunk way more hours into it than I would like to admit. I do have one suggestion  though. It would be really nice if later in the game we had access to the scrolls of magical infusion. You can spend so much of the game getting the perfect build and upgrading your weapon only to see that the cool effects of an infused weapon disappeared from upgrades. Perhaps we could buy this scroll in the demon halls or it could be a very rarely found scroll throughout the game.",5880,Shattered Pixel Dungeon is a vast improvement over the original Pixel Dungeon formula.

It's just stopped working and now all my stuff is gone

Review 2: A simple to use app that lets you save to device. The main issue is that if I don't close the app fully it stays on the same date for days. An example... If I open the calendar on the 1st of the month and come back to check the date on the 5th of the month it still shows the date as the 1st.

Okay just downloaded all the simple apps including the calendar on my tablet  they are great. The simple calendar on my phone still does not work properly but since downloading and synchronization with my tablet no known issues

Review 4: Sucks they added permission to read SD card. I chose this app because they didn't require access to my private data  other than that which I input directly to the app. I see they still don't request network access  but I won't be updating. Too bad since it's a good design.

Review 5: Update removed AM Scheduling. No matter what i try i can no longer make events for morning times. All events created default to 1 pm and though can be changed to another time  there are no options or effective swipe methods for switching to AM.

Review 6: Why can't i go beyond five months into the future? I am trying to input events in September and October when it is now April and it won't go beyond the end of August. Am i missing something?

com.simplemobiletools.calendar,Positive,"Review 1: Yea  won't import. I tried it every way. Export on my phone and copy file to my tablet and it says Error and won't import. Even when I do a new calendar and export. It won't even import back to a fresh install on same device  phone. If I may  I think it would be better if you focused on backing up the app not just the data. This way it would backup the categories and their colors  etc... I love this widget too. Makes a great looking home page. Please make it backup and restore. I also love that it is not dependent on GCalendar. If you use GDrive for backup it should also have access to that data on the SD too and then it would pretty much role the Playstore! :-) ...... I was so excited to see the new update for exporting and importing. Really bummed it doesn't work. Wish it was a true backup and restore of the app data. Please don't give up. This app has everything going on for it except a way to keep your info backed up. :-(

Review 2: You're awesome! I don't even care about syncing  it is offline calendar. I guess I'm missing something? What is the .DB export for  if it's not used to restore? But yet there's no way. This app and widgets are great. Looking forward to importing. I'll even donate now but I'm saving that last star for when I can restore lol. ~ This really is the best offline calendar on any platform but if I can't import/restore the .DB file then this is of little value for me. What happens when I get a new phone or want to keep the same data on my tablet? All your apps are cool and I love it being offline but you still need to be able to restore your data at some point or why bother. This is really an awesome calendar. Please consider adding backup and restore! 5 stars and I'll donate!!!

Review 3: This is a great monthly widget. Import/export doesn't really backup the categories or their settings. It imported some data but changed the times  off by an hour. First Monday of every month is No Parking on my side of the street because of the street cleaner. Hefty $50 fine if you are parked there from 8am to 2pm. The import changed all the times to 7am to 1pm on all my events. Not very reliable as a real calendar but makes a great looking widget. If your events mean anything to you  use a real calendar app like ColorNotes. I won't comment or rate this anymore until it can actually backup and restore the entire database. Until then  it's just a pretty widget.

Review 4: Hallo sir nice app..better den google calender...very simple and lowest data...but please provide a function to go to a date...foe i.e if i want to know the day of 1-1-91..den i can search it on the calender..and the monthly reminder sett to 30 on some 31 day months...for i.e if you sett a reminder on march 31...and fix it to repeat every month den it sett to 30 on may...but actually the last day of may is 31...finally please provide a function that we can sync our reminders to cloud...and also provide a function to sett reminder tones from our gallery..thank you..

Review 5: Finally a Calendar app without unnecessary permissions and sync features  which means that this app won't connect to the Internet at all. It's 100% offline. I've tried many calendars without using their sync features but they kept nagging me to set up syncing  which is very annoying. But then I found Simple Calendar. It's blazingly fast  lightweight and customizable. Only thing missing though is a way to export/import. DB but developer said it's on the roadmap which is awesome. Thanks a lot for your simple apps  dear developer. Keep it up. 5/5 stars.

Review 6: Calendar import is great! And it's the only calendar on the Play Store with a sane dark theme. Almost everything else I have to say  others have already said. Thank you for your amazing work; I'll love to see where it goes. That said  there are still a few things that could be smoothed out. The primary color could probably be extended to the scroll overflow shadows in the settings  and to the Recents view titlebar. More importantly  an AM/PM view might be nice; I accidentally scheduled an event for 2:00 AM because of the 24-hour time.

Review 7: I agree whole-heartedly with reviewer Amiris Brown that this application should never integrate Google Calendars except potentially as an *optional* add-on. I also agree with their thought that it would be nice to have holidays added; however  I feel this should also be an optional add-on  and should offer as great a variety of world holidays as possible  as well as moon phases. This application is great. I love it for its simplicity  its look  and for how it doesn't make me synchronize it to my Google account calendars. Thank you!

Review 8: Satisfied User Best calendar I've used  like it says simple  but Everything you need without the complications  just a thought for developer  could you please make days a little brighter  mon Tue Wed  ect  difficult to see on dark theme  thank you.........After update .

Would love list of daily activities below calendar This is a very nice and simple straight forward app. I also like the fact that it is standalone and does not integrate with anything else!

Review 2: Minor problems Although I was just trying the app for fun I ran into two problems. First time I launched it and took a photo  the phone crashed and restarted (no such issue after that) and photo orientation doesn't seem to work. Every photo I took was in landscape mode no matter the orientation of my phone. I like the dev's work tho  so no hard feelings.

Review 3: Nice app.. but. 1. The video recorder doesn't have a pause button. 2. Slow focus. 3. No flash torch option at the video recorder and 4. It's extremely time consuming to switch to video mode to camera mode.. I mean. Just make a button for it..

Review 4: After the last update  the app crashes after trying to take a picture with the back camera  front camera still works however. Video recording works with both back and front cameras. Update: After last update problem still persists.

com.simplemobiletools.camera,Positive,"Review 1: Near flawless camera app. Love 😍 it!!! Very simple app. Easy to use. Simple UI. sometimes simple is just better than all those confusing manual control. Heck I just want to take pictures! The only flaw I see in this camera app is that navigation bar buttons and camera buttons like the flash and snap buttons overlap with each other. It hard to click on the the camera buttons. Please fix this and this app will receive 5 ✨ instead of 4!! But I love this app! I'm using a Oneplus 2

Review 2: This is exactly what I was looking  a simple camera with no over the top features. If you don't use your camera often and only take a few pictures here and there  I highly recommend this app. As the title suggest  it is incredibly simple but functional. One cosmetic change I would like to see is the shutter/""""take photo"""" button. It makes the app feel a little dated. I think a simple circle like Googles camera app would look better.

Review 3: I know! I think they messed up big time. But your apps can still save to SD you just can't edit  rename  cut  copy or paste. ~ Camera is great. I wish it could let you send to a different path/folder where you can save. I like to have my photos and videos stored on the SD card instead of the phone's memory. Other than that it's a decent little camera for those quickie shots.

Review 4: New Z Camera This camera has to be the best on the market  it's so high quality  though there is one problem  maybe fix the delay after a photo  I love taking pics fast and I forget that after a pic I have to wait to seconds before I can move my phone or the pic will come out blurry. Other than that this app is the best on the market.

Review 5: Buggy  but has potential. On my galaxy s7  when i recorded  it said there was some kind of error. Then trying to switch from front facing to the back camera  It said that it couldn't do it. But it has potential to be a great app.

Review 6: Great idea  I love the concept of minimal permission simple apps. Seems to be doing the job. New version▶Crashes whenever the resolution change button is pressed (button between the movie camera symbol and last picture icon).

Review 7: First impressions Great idea  I love the concept of minimal permission simple apps. Seems to be doing the job. I can't see why I would want the flashlight on all the time? So haven't updated.

My only feedback is that I couldn't see all of the files of my internal storage even though I turned on """"show hidden files..."""". Not sure of that is an Android limitation? REPLY1: I was trying to find the internal storage folders where one would transfer ringtones  and I couldn't find it. I am not sure if it is some sort of an Android limitation that your app is experiencing for not being able to show those folders. But it would be another use case to support with your app if you could figure out how to let users use your app to transfer custom ringtones.

Review 2: A no fuss file manager that isn't a bloated piece of rubbish. Replaced my old simple file manager due to it not being updated in 2 years. This app gets the job done. I do wish switching to sd card was more apparent. Oddly you have to press the bit that says """"Internal""""  not press a visible button or swipe from the left for a menu.

Review 4: One of a kind A file manager that doesn't need access to the internet to manage my local files? Why hasn't any other file manager figured out how to do this? It can even move and copy files without my account information  knowing what apps are running or access to my contacts and calendar? What kinda black magic is this?

Review 5: can't browse SD (yes I tried the toggle)  can't multi-select files... most unintuitive FM... at least it's true to its word  and has enough common sense to not use the network for something so trivial... oh and of course  no ads.

com.simplemobiletools.filemanager,Positive,"Review 1: These are the sorts of apps we need more of: simple  efficient  well designed  and without unneeded permissions. There is however one feature which is sadly missing from this app which is sorely needed: the ability to see and access external storage through OTG USB. I find myself having to to access my flash drives through the default explorer and moving the files into internal storage before Simple File Manager is able to see them. This means I can't  for example  install APKs directly from flash drives or immediately copy images and videos two and from them through Simple File Manager alone. Despite this  this is an excellent app and I hope to see even more from the developers. Hopefully they allow SFM to eventually see external storage as well!

Review 2: Suggestion I suggest they include two tabs  one for internal memory and one for SD card. Because we have to navigate to the root folder and navigate from there to SD card. Or make the Storage folder the default folder when the app is opened. Other than that it is very good. Nice clean interface  no annoying popup messages  no ads  no unwanted permissions. Thank you :)

Review 3: Now replacing my old heavy file manager  it's simple  clean and functional. I love all of your apps. Suggestion: Please let me know how much space do I have on my phone  I know I can see it on the phone settings  but I'd like to see it right from the app.

Review 4: Part of a lovely app suite It's so rare to see such simplicity & honesty in apps these days. You won't go wrong with apps from this dev. Too bad this F.manager lacks the crucial sort function; deal breaker.

Review 5: No comparison  it's the best app. Please add recycle bin option. If possible then add usb support as well. Atleast add recycle bin option  this is must  even in the simplest app. It's superb. Keep it up.

Review 6: Perfect! Well  almost. I think this app needs the ability to zip files. Until then  this wouldn't be my primary file manager. Great app  nonetheless. Almost everything is textbook perfect.

Review 7: Previous file manager app disappeared after updating to Nougat. Now I can only update the files on the SD card! This app gives me total control especially music files  excellent.

com.simplemobiletools.gallery,Negative,"Review 1: I've loved this app. It has been my replacement for quickpic. But with the recent update hid ALL the files in my sd card. I was just trying to hide few folders. Idk what to do. UPDATE AFTER THE DEV'S REPLY: still nothing. It doesn't show any of my files on music apps or the stock gallery. Only in the file explorer. The way this mess started was by me selecting multiple folders and trying to exclude them  as it didn't work  i tried to hide them. Suddenly it gave me several ''unknown error'' bubbles and as i reopened it  it only showed the internal memory files. Nothing on my sd card is visible. I have very vital files in it  so i need a solution. Please. I think it's necessary for me to mention that i uninstalled and reinstalled the app  i also deleted several nomedia files in hopes it would fix my problem  but it didnt. Now that i reinstalled it  if i use the ''temporarily show hidden files1' option it does show me my pictures. But it does not restore my media in general. I cannot listen to my music or audio files in any player  only directly from the file explorers. Finally  i tried what you said in your reply  but the problem is the apo hid files i didn't even hide  so it doesn't even show me an ''unhide'' option for most of them. Please i expect a quick reply. Thanks in advance. Second update:files are finally appearing after trying twice more. Will this be a permanent solution? Can i safely exclude fiolders withtout my files being hidden by .nomedia files again?

Review 2: Still struggling to find all pictures and folders. Sort by date not working. Love the concept and the minimal permissions.

Glad to hear you'll try and fix it though Edit 2: The only issue I had with the app was fixed  and with speed that I haven't seen elsewhere  thank you! Changed my rating to 5 stars :)

Review 2: Simple  very FAST  & efficient. So far  it's my favorite gallery app. After the initial load (I have over 2 000 pics)  the app is very quick in viewing all pics for each album. You can change the background colors  increase the # of columns  move pics from internal to external memory  and when you edit a photo  it displays instantly in albums (unlike some other apps). Also  there are no ads. I only wish that the """"edit photos"""" button was one click away with a button on the bottom right of the screen (rather than 2 presses on the top right since I have a big phone)  but that's not a big problem for such a quick loading app. Thank you for creating such an awesome gallery!

Review 3: I just downloaded this app because for some insane reason my brand new Motorola Droid Play doesn't come with a gallery app preinstalled and for some reason my phone isn't compatible with the Motorola OEM gallery app. Crazy? But anyway  so far this app seems as good if not better than the one that would've come preinstalled! Like I said I did just download it but from what I can tell this is a really solid app that I would highly recommend to others if they find themselves in a situation similar to mine. Oh and don't lemme forget  no ads either  unbelievable  hats off to the dev. team. GREAT WORK DEVELOPMENT TEAM  YOU KNOCKED THIS ONE OUT THE PARK!

Review 6: No ads love it better than what the phone comes with Sell my phone only came with the Google photo app which as you know can only be used if you have internet so it was useless if there was no internet connection and you wanted to show somebody a picture I must have downloaded 20 - 30 apps this is the only one that I could find that had no advertisements and was fast just like a stock app should come with the phone if you're looking for a replacement Stock app this is definitely it no ads it's incredible they should charge at least $2 for this app

Review 7: Very promising Very nice app with a complete feature set. There is a bug where it does not detect gifs that are mp4 files. I need to force play them in this app by opening the file from another app  and then afterwards that file will appear in this apps folders. I would like to request a setting feature where it could play small gif videos on loop if the setting is toggled. Also an option to change the main colour theme would be icing on the cake. Functionality wise and UI wise  this app is great. Smooth and works well

Review 8: Was great until... I loved this app until one day it decided to save every app icon  video thumbnail  image from apps  and other images from random other places. I was even going to go through the hassle of deleting all these unwanted images clogging up my pictures  but as soon as I deleted them  they reappeared. I'm not just talking about a couple unwanted images  I talked about HUNDREDS. I went to the folder view to try and delete these new download/cache files  but no folder existed. Left baffled  I uninstalled.

Review 9: Finally  a QuickPic killer. The dev is responsive to problems immediately. The permissions are kept to a minimum. 10 stars! Addition: I've seen a few comments lately about the amount of updates being posted. Be happy that the dev puts so much effort into the app. There are a lot of different manufacturers and configurations of phones (various launchers  rooted phones  etc..). I just submitted a bug report yesterday afternoon and got the fix for it this morning. Respect! I remain by my evaluation: 10 stars!

Review 10: Very nice gallery  100% clean permissions  open-source and constantly updated and answered. // Suggestion: It would be very useful to have a mini horizontal gallery at bottom like in the Gallery app from Samsung. 2.2.1: still has some problem with files and folders; eg. one folder is displayed twice  one with the files whose names start with # and the other with the rest of the files.

All the necessary functionality for the utilitarian such as small profile notification bar and lock screen control with song info  shuffle/repeat  and basic track sorting. No unnecessary processing means I get an hour of play time (screen off) for only 1% of my battery life. It is exactly what I wanted. Thanks!

com.soyblue.bluesound,Positive,"Review 1: Awesome! Does exactly what it's advertised to do  and nothing more. No ads  no bloat. Interfaces all my audio to my mono headset  Netflix  music  even my Speaktoit assistant's audio is routed thru the bluetooth. Android 6.0.1 on a Sprint Moto Nexus 6 and Blue Parrott B250-XT headset (NOT the XT+  which directly supports music streaming).

Review 2: Those complaining about HD sound  get a life this wasn't designed for that. With that said  kudos for this app. Easiest way to connect bluetooth  and guess what? NO ADS!!!! For those complaining  this works well  I paid 2.99 for same type of app and couldn't get that one to connect or works kudos to the developer.

Review 3: Excellent It worked like a magic...i was stuggling to listen to music thru my mono samsung hm1100 bluetooth headset..this app has resolved my problem..It is playing videos too on my lenovo vibe p1.....Many Thanks to the developers

Review 4: Superb app but I request developers to add following some features 1. Background Play needed  as it stop when we close app 2. Option to select auto start after bluetooth device connect  and stop after bluetooth device disconnected

Review 5: Does what it says! Easiest way to connect bluetooth  and guess what? NO ADS!!!! For those complaining  this works well  I paid 2.99 for same type of app and couldn't get that one to connect or works kudos to the developer.

Review 6: It Works! Fantastic! I tried other apps with no success but this streams media to my samsung HM1300 which isn't designed for media audio! Congratulations on this 5star app.

Review 7: Awesome app! ❤ Sweet n simple app..... All others r useless not even connecting with Samsung latest devices but it really works!

Review 8: Actually worked I tried the other payed services and some other top rated free ones and this is the only one that worked thanks

com.termux,Negative,"Review 1: Wish it had better help section When I had to clean-slate my Android system - and thus reinstall this app - I couldn't install the PERL JSON (which before had really not been a problem). Nothing existed in the help-section or in Google to help me (at least nothing that worked) and the developer did not reply to my inquiry. --- In a sense  this inspired an improvement to my program by getting it to use JSON:PP rather than JSON - still  I no reason why there should be no help docs on how to do what I was able to do in this app in the past.

Review 2: MPV Broken after ffmpeg upgrade After upgrading ffmpeg this evening  I keep getting this message from MPV: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""mpv was compiled against a different version of FFmpeg/Libav than the shared library it is linked against.

Review 3: Good app and I cannot stop going on about it! There is one slight problem though: upon trying to run python scripts as root I get the following error: CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE DEPENDENCIES:library """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""libandroid-support.so"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" not found.Using root access I have searched data and there is indeed no such file.""""

Review 4: Great terminal emulator but the apt manager doesn't work as well as I had hoped. It can't seem to find ghc6... The error message was """"""""""""""""unable to locate package ghc6"""""""""""""""". Even after an """"""""""""""""apt-get update""""""""""""""""  it didn't work... Please fix the package lists or at least use the official apt package listings""""

Review 5: This app works properly on my Moto e having lollipop . But in this device I.e Moto g4 play with marshmallow """"apt install clang"""" not working I am getting """"unable to locate package clang"""" . Please fix asap . In marshmallow in permission section only storage is there . I guess may be that's the issue .

Review 6: Keyboard doesn't work and won't do basic commands Can't type commands because every time I type and go to hit space it does a weird copy of the previous string. Extremely frustrating. Also  won't allow me to do a basic apt install ssh. Tried apt clean and apt update. All in all it's useless as it is

Review 7: Needs keyboard extensions! It's annoying that it does have tab  escape etc keys that go above the keyboard like in juiceSSH. I find it easier to just ssh into a cloudbox than use this most of the time. People aren't gonna learn all new commands for a terminal emulator

Review 8: Cannot grant su! When I type in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""su"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and hit enter  it asks for superuser access  but the buttons can't be """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tapped"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". It's like my touch goes unresponsive for the time duration. This is so frustrating!""""

Review 9: Everything Works It's awesome! Just like having a real computer in your pocket (to which you can even connect and copy files via ssh). One thing that slightly frustrates me is that the software repo is kind of small and does not contain Haskell  which I need.

Review 10: Great app in general. But there is a big issue with its extensibility  because the packages downloaded with apt-get are not signed. This undermines the chain of trust: while the termux app itself is """"trusted""""  subsequent updates and extensions are not.",3373,"The app is great in general, but there is a big issue with its extensibility because the packages downloaded with apt-get are not signed.

com.termux,Positive,"Review 1: Devs  this is an awesome app. I've always been a console guy  and this app with a Bluetooth keyboard is  quite simply  THE BOMB. I do have one wish  though. One of the first things I do when I install a new system is swap the capslock and ctrl keys. A lot of the things I do involve control keystrokes  and it's just so much easier to slide my left pinky over and use the capslock key. I haven't figured out how to do that with Termux yet - if you could clue me in to how I might do that  or consider that sort of keyboard remapping as a future feature  I'd be very appreciative. I've literally found no other flaw with Termux - thanks so much for a true killer app. Update: I installed External Keyboard Helper Pro and it lets me do that remapping. I'd still prefer an internal option  since Termux is the only app I need the remapping in  but at least it gets me there. Update 2: Well  I take back that last. External Keyboard Helper Pro seems to work *sometimes*. But it DOES NOT seem to work within Termux. When I'm in my browser  for example  the capslock key works for ctrl-L to get me up to the address bar. But it doesn't work for ctrl-A D to detach from a screen session in Termux. :-( So  devs - can you find us a way to do this remapping within Termux? UPDATE 3: Ok  I did get it to work with External Keyboard Helper Pro  but to do so I had to use a custom mapping on all of the letter keys to tell them to ignore CapsLock. The CapsLock key does seem to function as ctrl  but it was ALSO doing its CapsLock function - so by programming the letter keys to ignore that all seems well. Whew...

Review 2: This is simply fantastic! GNU/Linux CLI in the palm of your hand --with the apt package-manager to boot! (It's a custom repo  but it has a pretty good selection  nonetheless. (The only thing I'm really missing is PDFGREP  and I bet there's a simple way to get it that I am overlooking.)) Oh  and my phone is NOT ROOTED  by the way  and that hasn't kept from me from doing anything yet. You can get Termux-API to add a few more features  like the ability to send and read SMS messages from the command line. You can also import your contacts  and more neat stuff. You get access to your SD card (after enter a short command one time). I was using (or attempting to use) one of the other most popular terminal emulators  but it was less than bare-bones - with no package manager... Needless to say  I was thrilled to discover this one. The controls are easy to adapt to within a day or two. (Volume up or down gives you your CTRL and/or ALT action.) I love running my scripts on my phone  and you just use [ termux-fix-shebang ] to make it executable in the app. (The directory path in Termux is a little longer than just /bin/bash .) I've even got $(apt list) and $(apt show) piping into dialog then into $(apt install) for a quasi-GUI type package manager setup deal. (It's dirty  but it gives me a selection box with descriptions.) Anyways  I could ramble on and on... I tried quite a few other options to have GNU/Linux in my Samsung Galaxy 6  but nothing compares to this. So  get this app if you love BASH! (or dash or zsh or fish ...-- with aptitude installed  you get choices!!!)

Review 3: Incredible app .. allows me to run all my essential linux console programs on my tablet or phone  with or without external bluetooth keyboard. Eg: Emacs/tramp editing over VPN; full access/editing of my encrypted org-mode files (synced with dropbox/dropsync); monitoring phone's resources with htop. And  if I'm at someone else's computer and need access to my stuff  I can just ssh into my phone and enjoy the convenience of big screen/keyboard/mouse with my portable server! :-) Yeah  it's slower than a desktop  but surprisingly usable. Before this  I had thought seriously about loading ubuntu onto my tablet to get this type of portable linux environment  but honestly  termux gives me pretty much everything I need (console-based for now)  plus android .. best of both worlds! Just when I'm already blown away  I find other really stuff in the well-written docs: multiple-sessions  keyboard enhancements (such as: press volume down to simulator ctrl)  termux-api (send/read SMS  text-to-speech etc.) ... just incredible. Great community and support too. Keep up the awesome work Fredrik  thank you.

Review 4: This app has definitely increased the value of having an android phone! Works like a charm in combination with Hacker's Keyboard! I could easily install python and then youtube-dl via pip so I can download videos/rip audio. I searched for an option to change font size  but didn't realize it was possible to change it with pinch zoom or double-tap and drag up/down. Incredible  but within minutes I had a working ipython console too! What else to wish for?.. A content filter to open/run """".sh"""" """".py"""" and other scripts from file managers. Currently Send intent results in a question to save to ~/Downloads. A welcome intro screen which would explain the basics would be handy too.

Review 5: I just plug in a USB keyboard - my phone's a tiny PC now. Good enough for writing code on it on the go. Apt-get  Git and Emacs (with billion packages) work flawlessly (even ASCII roguelikes). In Emacs  I can also use touch commands when I feel like it - clicking  scrolling  pinch zooming. Using real PC apps makes even legit Play-Store apps feel like toys. Termux's user interface looks like it's well thought out for multiple use scenarios and is really useful. There are other terminal apps  but this is the one that gave me the least problems and that just works.

Review 6: It gives me Linux commands on my Android without needing to Root What can I say. I rarely leave feedback on apps  but this deserves one. Does everything a full Linux setup does on your Android. Easy to add packages with apt install if it's not installed. It will tell you the exact command to type out to install the packages. No need to root. Commands have the most of the useful standard options  but not all. Still very useful none the less. I recommend a restart after install for package install to work properly. This is not very permission intrusive either

Review 7: Great  but needs more Thanks! Please add the media/files permission  I'm getting access denied when I try to access /storage/* /sdcard /mnt/user. I still think some basic color support (red/green/black/white options?) would be good  and that a real menu interface would be better than longpress (menu button support is nice  but most devices don't have one). It would also be nice to have an easy way to change the keyboard--I use hacker keyboard only with terminal apps  and only rarely  so switching is a pain. I'd be happy to pay..

Review 8: Overall application is good  but I can't get the source code using the command """"apt source package_name"""". It says that you must have to edit source.lst  but I tried that also  but the same error occurred every time. If you give me the solution to this problem or by solving this and then give us update. If you do this then I think it works 100% similar as the linux terminal does. Thanks in advance with hoping a answer in my favour. Regards  Krunalkumar Shah Famously known as Einstein

Review 9: This is actually a cli not even an emulator Well I was not able to install Linux on my pc   and I so badly wanted to get along with the class . This app helped me with it ! It's the only app which is soo helpful and it is genuine ! I am a Big fan of this app .. doesn't require too much of space  after you update some packages it requires some 25 to 30 mb but that isn't a problem   such a development on this platform is praiseworthy. Install and get rocking !

Review 10: Fantastic If you are looking for an app to transform your Android into a proper Linux system  look no further. Termux seamlessly integrates a self-contained Debian-like environment with the rest of your device's directory tree  letting you use familiar tools to work with your Android system. It combines the best qualities of a plain Android terminal emulator with a full sandboxed system like GNURoot Debian. An absolute must-have for Linux power users.",8163,The app allows you to run all of your essential linux console programs on your tablet. The controls are easy to adapt to within a day or two.

com.termux.api,Positive,"Review 1: it doesn't do anything after installing this it didn't add anything  I had to instead install it from the repo inside Termux. also  it'd be nice if it included an ncurses style client for SMS messaging using the API in the vein of mutt or vifm - that would make it basically the nerdiest/awesomest utility on the play store.

Review 2: Should be first step after... Should be your first thing to install after doing Apt-get update. Provides shell access to Android clipboard  my favorite  and many more system info and interaction functions. Remember to Apt-get install termux-api on the shell too.

Review 3: Works Nicely! I wish there were instructions that would appear within Termux once a person has installed this being that we have to look both in Playstore's READ area and in the referenced website for it  but still it does work eventually  and that's good!

Review 4: The API feature is great  just need loads more features adding - I would be willing to pay for these. Set volume  wifi/bluetooth on/off etc

com.thibaudperso.sonycamera,Negative,"Review 1: Can' t Connect to S4? A nice idea on theory but in reality my S4 isn't able to connect as a hotspot  through NFC or via a direct wifi connection with the camera (that's right - even when the camera and phone are connected via wifi this app fails to detect the camera). So until Sony can overcome the apparently enormous technical obstacle of actually connecting the app to the camera via the phone  this app is as useful as a dead battery.

Review 2: NFC won't establish Randomly misses shots on the a6000 and then won't continue so you can't rely on it. I have my camera on 30s and the app on 35s and success with that setting on star trails for up to an hour before it the camera stopped but the app continued. Unfortunately won't work on bulb. Hope you can make this so it could become a really good one!

Review 3: I used the app on a Sony RX10. It is easy to use but it does not allow zoom control and most importantly it does not respect the manual settings of the camera. The same is true for the PlayMemories app. Neither respects the manual settings on the camera. If you are using your camera as a point a shoot camera then I guess this could be OK

Review 4: could not connect rx100-m3 connection fails when trying to use from within blackberry os v10.3. query for network password comes up but nothing happens after entering the password. note that the rx100 m3 doesn't seem to have an option like 'control with smartphone' so i've tried other options like smart remote...

Review 5: Doesn't work with Sony RX10 Mkii Connects to my camera and gives me a preview however when it is actually supposed to start taking pictures it doesn't. I have the Mkii and it only connects with under the mkiii. Will happily give it a higher rating if it's fixed!

Review 6: My phone IS my Internet connection This app is looking for a WiFi but my phone IS generating the signal. Its a Hotspot. want so much to use this app. Can this be fixed? There won't be any WiFi where I want to take my camera

Review 7: Not sure if it's the app or the camera Doesn't work...Unless you only need the wifi connection to last through 10 frames. Worth trying  good interface  just isn't reliable.

Review 8: Doesn't support RX100-M4 Looks like a good app. But the Mark 4 isn't on the device list. I tried the M3 setting  but no luck as the M4 has a different menu option.

Review 9: Great Only issue is when camera is set to manual focus and manual control this software changes the camera to afs which isn't so good for time lapse photography

Review 10: You say that you support DSC-QX1  but it is not even in the camera model drop down! QX-10 / QX-100 QX-30 BUN NO F@#$ QX1 Thank for the misleading description!!!",2707,"The app does not allow zoom control and most importantly it does not respect the manual settings of the camera.

com.thibaudperso.sonycamera,Positive,"Review 1: Great  basic application that does just what it says. Using my HX50V and basic Android phone  I can get 2-3 hours of shots before the camera battery dies. (Using an external battery pack would easily double the time.) My only complaint is it seems to miss lots of shots. For example  if you set the interval at 15s for one hour  you'd expect 240 shots. But I usually only end up with 100 or so and there are gaps of 3-5 minutes between some shots. No idea what causes it and would like to fix. Otherwise great and thanks to the dev!

Review 2: Thenk you! About version 2.0.2: Very good application for my RX100-mk2. But  please  create more useful mode for manual shooting. Now it show me new page with photo after shot. For next photo I have to go back. It will be much more handy  if shoot button will be not disappear. Minor problem: application can not connect to camera at first time ? I have to reconnect (to press refresh button) few times. Landscape mode for application with bigger preview images would not superfluous too.

Review 3: Just installed it on my a 6000 and it worked flawlessly I just installed this app and it works perfectly. Great job because with the advent of people taking more selfies  this is a great app to make sure that we don't have to walk back and forth to the camera to do so  it is pure genius! Please let me know when you design it for the Sony DSC - HX90V. Thank you very much!

Review 4: If you downloaded the Timelapse App on your Sony camera and noticed that you are limited to 990 shots... this app is a godsend. Thibaud keep developing it! If you could add some more advanced features such as iso/shutter/aperture controls and limits I am sure you would find a bunch of us are more than happy to pay for it. Thanks for this!

Review 5: Not terrible but could be better It's quite good. easy to set up and use   but if phones screen sleeps or you switch applications it's stops the camera and you have to start all over again and keep the phone lit up for the entire time your taking shots which renders your phone useless. If it wasn't for that it would be a 5 Star.

Review 6: Rx100m2 - works very well Created perfect timelapse photos. Great setting options and live viewfinder is great. Count of photos taken and phone battery life are useful to see. Application does what it was designed to do well. Addition of more advanced features to further control camera wouls be great in future releases.

Review 7: It's awesome After connecting with A6000  I realized it has its own camera settings. I set that in the camera then turned off long exposure NR. It works perfectly fine for night sky timelapse. Sony timelapse charges $10 whereas this is free. This app deserves 5 star for what it offers.

Review 8: Fantastic I installed this app on my a7ii and had it synched and running in about 2 minutes. Incredibly intuitive and easy to use  clean and clear interface. The latest Sony cameras and Thibaud seem like a killer match! Keep up the good work!

Review 9: A5100 & Motorola E2 If it doesn't work you should check your camera settings. Put into auto or A or M just to be sure it's not user error because it seems the app does not do camera setting incompatibility checking. Awesome app thank you!

Review 10: Works as advertised Works perfectly with Sony a6000. There is a bit of delay but I can live with that. It needs the Remote app from Sony.

Review 2: Needs work This is a decent app  with lots of choices and the ability to add your own images. However  I had issues with sizing and moving objects because every time  the item would also rotate  making it extremely frustrating. Also  getting text to fit in a speech balloon is nearly impossible. There should be a way to tap on the balloon and have the text automatically fit in. This could be a great app  but it needs a lot of work to get there.

Review 4: Pauses a bit too much-- and it's NOT my tablet This is a great app for making Rage Comics and would be the first I recommend to anybody who likes to do it. The other problem is that it is kind of like the Internet Explorer of Rage Comic makers. Just a bit slow-- of course this doesn't reflect badly on the overall performance of the app... just is kind of annoying.

Review 5: Hate it Because it's just a drawing with a blank and I right a story but it keeps getting crashed and I just can't get to begin my story and it wont save to my gallery and I want to share to my friends but it's too small to right a story and I can't draw a car. I know u don't want to read this because it's too long but it's Ok because I'm just remainding it.

Review 6: Hate the way it cancels my comics Saving doesn't work Very complicated Add more faces why are these labeled wrong Opens and my comics have their panels squished into 4 panels Erasing doesn't save There are way more issues this app sucks just another turd Unless you don't quit and like complicated stuff If you are not like me give it a chance

Review 7: Help I really like the app but I've got a big issue: I can't save or share rage comics I made! When I try to share  it tells me """"""""""""""""invalid dimension""""""""""""""""  and when I save the file it appears on my gallery as unreadable. It says that the resolution is -1x1. Will give 5 stars if the issue gets resolved""""

Review 8: So many problems 1) Finding the faces/images is so difficult. 2) Can't save my comic  it says saved on the drive  tried to find it but nothing. 3) Can't post it  I tried to post it on 9gag it says 'different dimension'...what?! 4) So many more problems but these are the first thing that I encountered.

Review 9: Great app I finally can do my own comics   add texts and rage faces   draw and add photos from my own gallery I advice everyone to install it and don't let the logo make U think it's bad ... but it's really running sloooowly and it couldn't add photos from my gallery anymore . Please fix this ....

No wonder it's called a rage maker!!! Do not by this app it's all a lie. The game you should go to is levels created by Megan methcarty and see her awesome vines and people stop making fun of her voice.

Review 2: (Was) Awesome App! EDIT: I have not been able to add my own images for some time now. Error with every attempt. This was my most used app at one time  but not being able to add my own pics has caused me to stop using it. I will bump back to 5 *'s if/when this issue is resolved.

Review 3: Awsome but needs more meme faces I loved all of this and it's awsome and fun! But I looked at it and not all of the meme faces in there.... their is not a lot of female stuff in their.. so I recommend you put more meme faces in their please. Otherwise  awsome app :3 P.S can u please make it that we can draw on the memes please   thanks :3

Review 4: Me gusta I love this app  it let's me make good comics and for absolutely FREE!!! I do have some suggestions like fixing the draw function  as it pauses for a second when I try to draw  and it can mess up my flow  and I would like to have an option to enlarge the eraser  that is all  thanks for the amazing app!!!

Review 5: EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT OF! This is amazing! You can chose from hundreds of rage faces from the derp  to FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!!! However the drawing ability is kind of lacking. You can use your fingers [PAUSE] but you cant use a pen. Nevertheless  if you like rage comics give this a try and make your own!

Review 6: Cool Like it very very much my friends love the funny things i made for them this is amazing thumbs up up up higher .... but hope there won't be disappointment in the future for this app cause there's lot of apps is like at first it's good but later SUCKKKK but keep it up don't let down RAGE COMIC MAKER

Review 7: Enjoyable But could you please add the rage comics area it only has 4 area to put a picture and is very limited to make a funny rage comics and could you please add fonts and fix the lags and bugs of the manipulation mode Thanks for making this app really appreciated it for being awesome

com.totsp.crossword.shortyz,Negative,"Review 1: This app probably takes up 90% of my screen time on my phone. I'm addicted to crossword puzzles. Between the vast selection of puzzle libraries and the live-ish updating of ongoing publications  I'll never run out of games to play. Note  however  that I've been running Shortyz for years and although the app does get updated from time to time  the updates are sporadic at best. Bugs can go months before being addressed. The current bug plaguing the game is the Clues view zooms in ridiculously on the letter grid  making it difficult to use. But  like I said  the app does get updated and things do get fixed in time. This bug has been reported and I will wait until it's fixed. It's an annoyance regardless  so I'm docking it a full star for an otherwise stellar app.

Review 2: Miss some features Lost two stars because I previously had a Galaxy Fascinate which would not allow the latest updates on this app. Recently got a new S6 and got the app again because I really loved it an used it most every day. Some problems now. First  the highlight errors will not work. I see in settings where you can turn them on or off  but it doesn't work. The second is  and I am not sure if it is not working or had been deleted with the update  but before I could touch the clue or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Box"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" that I wanted to enter text into  now that feature seems to be missing. The combination of these two things make it much less enjoyable. Does anyone have a fix or is it possible to revert to older version?""""

Review 3: After the update the """"""""""""""""delete"""""""""""""""" key in the board stops if the letter is correct and I have to use the directional arrows. So if I accidentally type in several wrong letters because for some reason I am """"""""""""""""off"""""""""""""""" on the board and need to delete I cannot just use the delete key to remove ALL the letters. I know maybe that's a silly thing  but it won't allow me to move out of the box of a correct letter. So if I am using the keyboard without the directional arrows  which is an option  I have to tap on the screen which doesn't always end up in the box I need to be in  making this a sometimes frustrating problem.""""

Review 4: Have played this game for years. Like many  I dislike the new version  but I learned to live with it. So  why the one-star? Because the game simply refuses to work on my new Note 4 running Lollipop. I can enter a word or two  but then when I try to select another word  the app refuses to respond. I tried installed version 3.3.15  but that had the same issue. This is really too bad - there are no alternative crossword apps out there. If the author is not going to maintain the app  he should then release to code to the public so that others can take over maintenance responsibilities.

Review 5: I have plenty of space but I am deleting the app that was once my favorite. Maybe the designer has had personal issues that have caused him to abandon his software and since he never charged for his product  he owes us nothing. I wish he had rolled back two versions before he did  but  again...his project. I just no longer want it reminding me of what it was. EDIT: There are really good reasons to be aggravated with the software  but dropping stars because you were offended by a puzzle provided by a 3rd party is just plain stupid.

Review 6: Won't link to New York Times crossword subscription I've used this app for several years and enjoyed it  but recently I decided to buy a subscription to The New York Times crossword. I have been unable to link the two together in spite of going to the Shortyz's subscription page and entering both email and password. Shortyz app doesn't respond to the input and will not download NYT crosswords. I cannot see what I am doing wrong  if the fault is at this end. Please fix this; it's the only reason I purchased the subscription.

Review 7: Thank You  But Please Fix this! Update to previous review: Very annoying! I have upgraded to the Galaxy S5 Android 4.4.2  and this issue with the touch not responding when trying to select squares in the grid is still there. ...even worse. Now I see that several other people are complaining about it. It certainly takes the enjoyment away  when I have to touch several times to select a square to fill. I used to love it  but since last Android update to 4.3  selecting squares has been very difficult. AT&T Galaxy S3

Review 8: Latest version buggy I have used it for quite some time  but the latest (Android  running on One Plus One) version has at last two bugs. When a crossword is partially or fully competed and you go back to the main page  the crossword is not often saved. For example  I just finished a crossword  and the main page showed 3% completion. The second problem is that the crossword is randomly resized to a smaller version and it's hard to work with it. Otherwise  it has been a workhorse for me and I've been a happy user.

Review 9: Poor Grid Controls Except for the two right-most and bottom-most words  Skip Filled Boxes toggles movement to the end of the word even if previous boxes are empty along the right and bottom edges. Fortunately this is not the case for other positions on the grid: sometimes I like to enter answers backwards. Having to move to the first empty box takes multiple attempts because screen sensitivity is poor. (Not having Skip Filled Boxes ON is a bigger hassle  as is any Movement Style other than Stop at the end.)

Review 10: Undo last update I used to love this app. This update ruined it. clue box is way too big. Won't save if you adjust the size. Half the time you can't click a box to add a letter. Incorrect letters go between showing red (used to be wrong) or pink (used to show it's correct but previously had an error). When you delete or archive a People Magazine puzzle  when you log back  it re-downloads it...Every. Single. Time. I don't want that puzzle anymore but I can't get rid of it. Fix and I'll give your stars back.",5975,Shortyz takes up 90% of my screen time on my phone. The Clues view zooms in ridiculously on the letter grid making it difficult to use.

com.totsp.crossword.shortyz,Positive,"Review 1: People need to be patient! The app needed to be updated to match the new style guides  and I  for one  think it looks much better now! Of course there are a few glitches here or there but the developer is responding quickly. I think sheer volume of negative responses demonstrates how many people rely on this app every day  and let's remember it's free without any ads or anything. Let's all be a little more patient when we notice a small issue. I can guarantee the dev won't leave us with a broken app for long (and in my experience it's far from broken) Further  if you're having an issue with a specific puzzle  I can virtually guarantee it's because that source has changed something. When that happens this app's dev has always been very quick to respond whenever possible (it's not always within his power).

Review 2: Current version (as of this review) is unusable on my phone. For some reason  when switching to Clues mode  it zooms the entry boxes until they're huge and I can only see 4 on screen at a time. I can zoom out  but as soon as I move to a new clue it zooms back in like this. None of the zoom settings affect the zoom of the clues mode. Meanwhile  I can't work in puzzle view because my screen is too small. This all seems to work fine if you have a tablet  and it used to be my favorite game on my phone (when I could see 8-10 letters on the clue screen)  but it's just unusable on a small screen now. FWIW  I really appreciate the author's work. Like I said  I used to love this program. I think it just hasn't been getting tested on smaller screen phones lately...

Review 3: This is the only """"""""""""""""game"""""""""""""""" that stays on my phone. AFAIK  it is the best of its kind and provides access to a wide range of puzzles without needing a subscription. A glitch: On Galaxy Note 3 (Android 5)  in the """"""""""""""""Clues"""""""""""""""" mode  the letters in the answer area exceed the squares and are cropped. I'd be happy to send a screenshot. An enhancement request: A 1-key method to move between clues. Suggestion: permit a long-press on the keyboard arrows. LP on left/right moves to prev/next clue across. LP on up/down moves to prev/next clue down  Thanks for a great program. Where do I pay?""""

Review 4: Update is a disaster Well  the new update has cured my Shortyz crossword addiction. I LOVED this app but they have sacrificed everything to some designer's aesthetic. The download system (if you want older puzzles) is a sporadic mess; you can't even see the day of the week on the calendar. The keyboard choices aren't as good. And the puzzle list used to be nice and compact...now you see far fewer choices on screen. My older review  which gave it 5 stars said: This is the best free xword app I've tried. Many new puzzles daily...and from great sources like the la times.

Review 5: Thanks for your latest update (Nov. 2014). This app has many great features  and we appreciate your continous improvements. One bug from this last update was fixed as I was writing this - fast work! Now  if you can just make the in-app keyboard better  I will happily give you 5 stars. I have small hands and fingers  but still miss the correct letter as often as I hit it. Since I really like the app feature which keeps track of errors (which I rarely make)  typing errors are frustrating as well as time-consuming. Looking forward to this fix. Thanks again!

Review 6: Best crossword app out there (with caveats) Used this app on multiple older (pre 2015) samsung and lg devices with little to no probelms. Over that time  the app has grown and developed into something really elegant. However  after upgrading recently to the lg stylo 2 plus  I have been finding that the hit boxes for the answers are hard to find especially near the sides of the puzzle. Both with the stylus pen and my fingers  it is difficult to find the right place to trigger the answer boxes. I have no similar issues with any other apps. Plz fix.

Review 7: BEST UPDATE IN YEARS! Thank you! New update 10/13/15 === YES! Finally! I've been using this app for YEARS. It's my favorite app and I use it virtually every day. Several years ago the app stopped downloading the majority of the puzzles I loved  leaving me with just a few puzzles to solve. Now  with the new update  I have access to every puzzle again! As promised  I raised my rating back up to Five Stars. The variety of puzzles can't be beat. Hands down the best crossword puzzle app available on Google Play. PERFECT UI. Thank you!

Review 8: Great  with a few small flaws Unlike others  I actually like the new material design - kudos for keeping it consistent with Lollipop. Also  good job fixing the delete issue. Small issues are the download date picker doesn't show the day of the week  and the keyboard doesn't allow number entries (this has prevented completion of a couple of crosswords). Much larger issue is that square selection seems to be hypersensitive - the slightest sideways movement as you tap is interpreted as a pan rather than a select. Using a Galaxy S6.

Review 9: Two Puzzles Keep Showing Up Again and Again I like this app  and the features work for me. The only reason I need the swipe to delete function  is because two puzzles keep downloading again and again. Not every time  but I think on Mondays. People Magazine """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Fierce and Fabulous"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and New York Times Classic  a Wednesday puzzle from 1998  I think. Fix this glitch and you can easily do away with the swipe to delete feature (or you could add a confirmation button to appease the slippery fingers).""""

Review 10: Having a new issue I love this app. Since the new look update  I've had a new issue. I tend to tap on a square and then immediately tap it again to change from across to down or vice versa. I basically double tap a lot while moving around. Since the update  about half the time  when I perform this double tap  it's like I triple tapped. Eg  it highlights the row  switches to the column (where it should stop)  but after a brief pause  it switches to the row again. Irritating  but not debilitating.

com.twofours.surespot,Positive,"Review 1: First the good. Slick UI  secure encryption and doesn't require a telephone number a huge plus point - difficult to run an SS7 attack on an iPod! Now the not so good. Based in the USA. Not open source & the big one (for me at least) the app allows for private key to be installed on any number of devices - this just opens the door for Man in Middle issues. Bottom line? Despite the negatives I kinda like Surespot for its simplicity and clean UI  so intuitive even your granny could use it. That said  it's not my main app when it comes to secure communication.

Review 2: Awesome chat app Most efficient use of screen space I've found in a messenger. Conversations are presented in a compact yet easy to follow manner  ideal for those that prefer content over cartoon bubbles. It's private  it has voice mail  it even has new emoticons to fill in the gaps for those of us with older android versions. All this and it doesn't demand your phone number or email address! Thank you Mr. Developer!

Review 3: Nearly perfect Ui is terrible  terrible enough that I can't get my friends to use it. My iPhone friends tell me the iOS version makes their phone act unstable(?) Idk  iPhones....... absolutely love that it's local only and easy to completely destroy your account with no option of recovery! This app is great though IMHO it's the best of its kind. Fix the iOS issues and update the UI and I will give 5 stars!

Review 4: Good and secure Can't really fault this app - it does what it claims. Personal preference - be able to turn off random emoticon sent with each message - seems a bit silly though not good reason to drop a star - Good app 👏👏👏👏👏 (my choice of emoticons!) Wish list; be able to see if a message has been read. Turn off ability to take screenshots within app.

Review 5: It's great! Working fantastically. I would love a feature that shows if the message has been delivered and read  but that is low on the list of priorities I had for a secure messaging app  surespot checked all the boxes except that one! Especially not having to sign up with my phone number! Thanks for making a fantastic  easy to use app.

Review 6: Good So far so great  the application has been very useful and i feel that i will continue to use it unless i encounter problems. If i do i will update this review. I would give 5 stars but the voice is the only problem that i have because its not free but not everything is.

com.u17od.upm,Negative,"Review 1: Good simple app  mostly I picked upm for its cross-platform support  not its looks or features  and it's pretty good at its job so far. One problem: if I ever forget my password it looks like I won't be able to delete the database; no options are available until after the password is entered  and cloud restore brings it back automatically. I'm not happy that it didn't ask my permission before backing up to the cloud either - sure it's encrypted  but security leaks happen.

Review 2: Multiple Phones Issue This app will not open if it is downloaded to multiple phones. I cracked my phone and now that I have the replacement  the app refuses to let me in. I know multiple downloads is the issue because it happened before and after deleting from the old phone I was able to get in. Well now I can't delete the app from the old S5 because the screen is shattered and won't display anything. Goodbye passwords :-(

Review 3: Back up sucks I put my faith in this password keeper when I backed up the data base and now 10 minutes later when I'm trying to restore them all  we'll you probably guessed it there not there. This freaking blows and it has every password I use. Do not download without backing up manually on your own  Warning I say again DO NOT DOWNLOAD WITHOUT BACKING UP YOUR PASS WORDS MANUALLY ON YOUR OWN.

Review 4: I used to love this app  but I recently had to do a factory reset of my phone  and although I've used this app for many years  my data is lost. This is absolutely horrible  especially since it was supposed to backup to the Android cloud. This is the only time I have not had my data restored  but now that I have a kiddo  I had necessary parent/child info saved and cannot retrieve it.

Why isnt there any easy way to reach support....this app was a 5 before this mess...anyone tell me how I can reach somebody to help me??

Review 6: Not as advertised This app has been great for years until the last time I upgraded my phone. I got the new phone  installed the UPM app and went to set it up and nothing. I tried every option they had and nothing. I lost EVERY SINGLE ONE of my username and passwords. I must've had over 40 accounts that I lost. I have since switched to password keeper. So disappointing.

Review 7: Doesn't always upload when syncing The app doesn't always upload to my dropbox when I sync it after making changes. I add accounts to UPM and click sync but it only tries to download a new database but doesn't upload the new one. If I sync my tablet  the changes I made on my phone don't download to my tablet so I know that the app isn't uploading.

Review 8: HELP My wife loves this app  but has suddenly been locked out of her phone and cannot access it. Seems to be a glitch in the phone since the last upgrade. I just read that the app now backs up somewhere. How long has that been the case? Is it possible that there is a recent backup file that would allow us to factory reset her phone?

com.u17od.upm,Positive,"Review 1: I have been using this app for a few years now with no trouble using it until today. My galaxy S3 required a factory reset so I made a backup to my pc. When I moved it back and subsequently tried to login to my old database  the app tells me Invalid Password. *UPDATE* I resolved it by uploading my backed up database from my pc to my dropbox  fresh installed UPM  told UPM to sync database from my dropbox. Somehow that was different than dragging the database from my pc to phone  but hopefully this helps someone. Score changed back to 5 Stars.

Review 2: Dependable easy deserves 10 stars This password keeper has served me reliably through 3 phones now plus various notebooks laptop. It never fails to retrieve my data.i store the database on dropbox free version. Im so nervous when i tic that retrieve box but boom every time. Id never remember all my stuff.easy to sync edit add.just mail yourself the main password because you cant get it from them if you forget it. Happy happy!

Review 3: Awesome Security App! I have been using this app everyday for close to 2 years now and think it is awesome!!! I used to write all my passwords down in a notebook  but UPM is much more organized and you only need to remember your master password. Plus  I have the app on my tablets too. And now that there is cloud storage  I don't have to manually enter all the passwords and info into a new device! Love it!!! Thank you!

Review 4: Very dependable I've used for years to store passwords as well as other important data. Those who complain about lost data when getting new device or doing factory reset need to do a bit of planning. As the database is encrypted  just copy it to your Dropbox or Google drive and then back to your device after the reset I use this technique to keep the same database on both my phone and tablet. Works very well.

Review 5: I have passwords from along time ago. This app doesn't ever bug me. I put in my master code  and it gives me all the tabs for my other pw's.. Like apple id  chase Bank  sprint... Et al.... Lets me add notes also... And thru Dropbox  I could transfer everything to new phone and my tablet with ease.... Just don't forget ur master pw at the beginning.. Otherwise u will love this app. Can I give it 6 stars?

Review 6: Help! I've used this app & have been happy with it UNTIL my phone stopped working & I had to have it replaced. I downloaded this app  wrongly assuming that my info would be there. It's gone. If anyone can help me I would appreciate any help you can provide. If I can retrieve my info & will give you a 5+++ stars & will rewrite my review. Thank you!

com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid,Positive,"Review 1: Best Android IRC client. I've gone through all  and I mean all of them  and this definitely the best. I know this is basically not a real IRC client  but it is still the best. I would give a solid 5 starts but there's a small bug: the app crashes on open if there are no new messages on any of the channels. Or at least it seems like that's the reason. Happenes on both  Marshmallow and Nougat. Otherwise the app work amazingly.

Review 2: This app is absolutely fantastic! I was worried it might chew up a lot of battery being in the background all of the time  but that is absolutely not the case. Very  very light on battery usage. There are a few small quirks like a limited buffer size (I think it might only be 500 lines and is a fixed number).

Review 3: Awesome Very nice to use on both tablets and phones. Nice amount of customization and the SSH tunnel feature is a cool extra. And it's completely free and open source  with no in-app purchases or ads  which is hard to come by these days.

Review 4: Was amazing before  and just became better I used this app every day  and I've been doing that for quite some time and it served me well. But the latest update just made it so much better!

Review 5: Best IRC client for Android Requires Weechat relay to be available externally. Regardless  best IRC client for Android hands down.

Review 6: Most amazing IRC experience for Android I wish more IRC clients had this kind of interface and user experience!

com.umang.dashnotifier,Negative,"Review 1: Underwhelmed Works ok. But lacks ability to customize field for extension name. Also shows only sender and so little of subject for emails I'd rather not even bother. Other apps work better... Albeit not all in one place... But this does function as advertised.

Review 3: It's not working. It's not working on Android 4.4.4. (Sony Xperia Z3) Everything is properly routed between apps  but still  nothing appears on lockscreen. Other DashClock widgets work fine. Will five-star as soon as the problem is solved.

Review 4: Nice work  but too big of a RAM expense On my tablet this extension takes over 50 MB of RAM  when the host takes a reasonable 15 MB (better dash clock). Sorry  I just can't afford the hit. Shrink the package somehow and I'm all in.

Review 5: Slow updates. Some notifications will stay on DashClock hours after they have been dismissed. I can't manually refresh or update DashNotifier  so I will see Hangouts and Facebook messages on the lock screen long after I read them.

Review 6: latest update broke the app for me instead of the message content it just says """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""whatsapp"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" multiple times for every unread text. i'm on stock kk on moto g  please fix it  used to be an awesome app.""""

Review 7: Disappointed I would give it a five if I was able to use it. I can't find the settings to the app itself on my phone anywhere! I turned on it's accessibility but still can't find the settings for the app. Help me out here...!

com.umang.dashnotifier,Positive,"Review 1: Good  with one issue This extension works beautifully  except in one case. Multiple notifications (non-stacked) from one application seem to break its counter. Case in point  I have two Gmail accounts set up on my phone. When either one gets an email while the other account doesn't  everything works fine. If both accounts get an email and show a notification  however  then the widget starts acting oddly. Anyone know of a fix for this? Loving this otherwise  and I really want to rate it a 5.

Review 2: Almost Perfect The app in itself is amazingly good  I started using it after the apps by tiger-workshop were pulled from the Play Store. I just have one item in my wish list  I'm trying to replicate the behavior those apps had  they always showed notification count as the content (1 new message  2 new messages  etc.). I was hoping you could add this behaviour (or any other way to customize what is shown in notification content)  if you do that your app will be completely perfect!!

Review 3: Amazing widget! As others have said this is a MUST coming from iOS for those who are used to having all their notifications automatically display on their lock screen. This is even better than iOS because you can choose what notifications you want and leave out the ones you do not want. EDIT: My only suggestion is to make the ability for more extensions than 10. But it does not keep it from 5 stars. Plus the tiny 4mb RAM usage makes this app almost perfect.

Review 4: One dashclock extension to rule them all A little tedious to configure  but this saves you having to install different extensions for each so that you want to include in dashclock. One improvement it could really do with is showing the name of the configured app in the dashclock extension list  rather than just dashnotifier 1  dashnotifier 2  etc. That would greatly enhance ease of use.

Review 5: Must have A must have addition to the DashClock widget. Makes receiveg notifications from ANY app as easy as it gets. Especially for Nexus 5 owners  who like me do not receive Whatsapp notifications through the Whatsapp DashClock extention. One improvement I could suggest: change the icons of the extentions (in the DashClock settings menu) according to the app it is showing.

Review 6: Very useful  kinda buggy Very good job. If only Dashclock had this by default (but some devs have no sense) because it's a must-have. Only problems are: it doesn't disappear on unlock like I set it to  it needs a renaming feature and needs option to set ?Do nothing"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as click action. Oh  and the screen doesn't come on even though I checked the box.""""

Review 7: Great addition to Dash Clock. Is it possible for dash notifier to inherit the open characteristics of a system notification? Hangouts example: tapping the dash notifier notification for a hangouts notification opens hangouts in the overview  but opening the system notification for hangouts shows the conversation from the user that sent the message.

Review 8: Awesome. Great for hangouts notifications So far  this app has made it possible for me to get chat and SMS/MMS notifications from Google Hangouts in the DashClock widget.... and for that  5 stars! My one criticism: It would be nice if you could rename the Dash Notifications instead of them all having the same name with a number appended.

Review 9: Awsome Possom! One of the must-have plugin apps for Dashclock. Whatsapp  Kakao  SMS  Keep  Facebook  Twitter... DashNotifier has it all. Highly  customizable too! One thing i cudnt find is the Battery extension. Dear Dev  if you could please add that extension  you would help me get rid of an otherwise pointless plugin app ;)

Review 10: Good  but not ehat we need ! Thanks for this extension  However  I want it to be more smart and intelegent !

Review 4: It is good  but... I only gave it three stars for the fact that I cannot add books to my library from this app. Or the fact that you cannot see other books in the same series. You can't even look at other books by the same author. Besides that  it is a good app to have for Smashwords.

com.vrem.wifianalyzer,Positive,"Review 1: Great app  with lots of information other versions of apps with the same name do not have. For example connection speed in Mbps and estimated distance  which is remarkable accurate. Suggestions for improvement: Make it easier to switch between 2.4 and 5 GHz  which is now hidden in the settings. I think this should be more like a tab or a switch in the menu itself. Another suggestion is to show more information on the connected accesspoint after clicking on it. e.g. SSID hidden  DHCP details (incl IPv6)   802.11 standard used (like 802.11ac)  latency and whether or not it is connected to the internet.

U will B placed on our list of trustable open source Network tools. Cheers.

Review 3: Does what it says Works great. It'd be nice if the access point list would be more compact. Only 5 or so can be fit on the screen at one time. In dense areas with large number of APs fitting 15-20 on the screen at once would be nice. It would be nice is there was logic to identify APs with multiple BSSIDs and merge them in the list (same channel with similar MAC addresses) to take up less space and get a smaller AP list.

I'm sure there are other enhancements it could do with  but it does what I need. **It's from someone whose PS credentials jive with the app's signature  which is extremely important to me. **It doesn't need excessive permissions  only Wi-Fi. **It has no ads; excellent! **It's free; bonus. **It's pleasing to the eye  and well-designed. **Thanks!

Review 5: Needed an app to check signal coverage / strength around outside of the house to decide where to install outdoor wifi security cameras. Downloaded and tried this app due to good reviews. Verdict : worked a treat. Simple to use  very clear readings and of course - no apps !!! Will also be useful for other tasks around the house. Highly recommended. Great work devs.

Review 6: Well done! The only thing I did not find here  as well as in many other comparable products  is a [optional] logging. One line per scan  with comma-separated data of each found AP  would be enough. The rest I can do by scripting. I know  this is rather uncommon  but for some users  under some circumstances  this may be really handy.

Review 7: I used the heck out of it on job sites and at home. Very handy. People that complain just probably don't know much about radio wave readings. This app does a great job. Couple of things I wish it had...... Copy to clipboard would be cool. Allow aliases to be assigned to macs. I get so confused when dealing with a large customer.

It just flips back to the last folder.

Lasted one month then vuze said it couldn't do it anymore. I would like a function that I can que a magnet link in this app to download and it would start downloading once it can get a connection to my server.

After the recent update to the app  the polling is significantly more responsive/accurate  GUI has been updated to be better skinned  and the whole thing doesn't lag waiting for network responses.

And maybe remote access complete folder where torrents are saved. Not just what is currently in vuze on computer.

Review 3: Enemies are hard to kill  traps will popup out of nowhere  you dont get a good light radius to find your way around  plus any shops are non-existant in the first 4 levels. There should also be a shield  helmet  boots  gauntlets  and greaves added to the game so your character is better defended. A small shop should exist on levels 1-4.

Review 5: Old and crusty dungeon crawling mechanics better left in the past. At first Pixel Dungeon looks like a more modern version of dungeon cralwers of the past  but it suffers just like a large amount of them did from random combat  unintuitive game mechanics(potion making comes to mind)  and lots of instant death frustration. There's little thrill in finding new items since even equipping unidentified equipment still leaves it unidentified! Also there isn't a hungry meter I can see? Pixel Dungeon exibits some of the least fun dungeon cralwing mechanics in recent memory.

Review 6: Some good and some bad Good: The game is very true to the rougelike genre and challenging  prepare for several doomed first attempts and to learn from your mistakes in order to progress. Random dungeon generation makes repeat plays fresh and is very repayable. Bad: The randomness of weapon/armor drops make it difficult to get past some of the early stages  especially if the ghost side quest provides minimal value. Deterioration is a pain and serves no real point other than to provide another way to screw over late game players.

Review 7: Difficulty based on chance and obfuscation This game has every element that should make it good. Unfortunately there are several classic blunders that just make it missed the mark. Food is required  yet food is not plentiful within the dungeon. All items you pick up are unidentified the first time you see them yet you don't get enough ways to identify them short of using them and hoping. I suppose over time you would learn what all the items are  but if that's the intention what exactly is the point. It is a useless mechanic.

Review 8: Everything kills you There's a point where you realize  there's no way to win this game. Even if the dungeon is endless  there would be no way to find out if everything kills you by level 3. I've tried playing as the warrior  mage and rouge  but to no avail. If this game is meant to be a challenge  there has to be a reward. There's a strength point system that I don't understand. There's a search option that only seems to work for finding secret doors. The only selling point is the extremely repetitive level theme.

Review 9: Hmmm Huntress should NOT lose her Boomerang on death. Makes no sense since that is the main feature for that class. Also if you have an Ankh  why do you lose all your bags & equipment upon dying? Ankh should auto-rez you like the Dew Vial filling upon reaching 0 Health or let you pick up your old equip from your corpse since its still the same run. Makes having an Ankh almost useless if you have to build up your entire BP again with only 25 levels. Having a soft save ability at interval bosses would be nice also

Review 10: A love/hate relationship. This game is a frustratingly-unfair mobile masterpiece. One wrong turn in this deadly dungeon  you'll find yourself back at square one  all knowledge of potion effects lost: meaning you have to try them and probably set yourself on fire. It's a vicious cycle. That been said  the mechanics are superb for a mobile platform. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Just one more try"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is something you'll probably be muttering a lot. Download PD and get ready to hate yourself  in a... good way?""""",5827,"The music is pretty good, but everything else is mediocre to awful. The worst part is that death is permanent. A small shop should exist on levels 1-4. Starvation feature should be taken out because its very annoying. Rations should have the ability to provide healing for 5-7 seconds."
com.watabou.pixeldungeon,Positive,"Review 1: PD Is amazing... But just one small complaint I've been playing Pixel Dungeon give or take about 4 years  and I loved it from the beginning. There was a point where I had a hard time keeping up with the game because of all of the updates that was over a year ago so I'm going to try it again. It has been a source of inspiration in my D&D play  and it has never ceased to keep me entertained  no matter how hard or easy I may find it. I especially enjoy a game that is well built  evenly balanced  and takes up less than 30 megabytes of information as if to say; I've been thinking about your Hardware  and I appreciate your patronage. The only time I've had a problem with this game glitching up was due to my own Hardware  completely irrelevant to this game. Except for every so often  I'll touch one part of the screen and my character will want to go the long way  or something out of the way of where I was attempting to go. I don't know if that's a hardware or software problem  but I've encountered it on multiple devices. Regardless this game is fun to play in my opinion. And for those of you with Android consider yourself lucky because you have to pay for it on Steam Powered and iOS all things considered I still think it's worth it!

Review 2: Amazing game I have had this game on three different devices and played it for almost two years. I have beaten it with the Warrior  the Mage  and the Rogue. Working on the Huntress currently. Yes  the game is hard but once you have a good strategy you will have farther runs each time. Wait until you are starving to eat your rations and your health is low  or medium if you're not that brave. Stretching your rations is a must. If you have no ration and say 5 hp potions use hp potions until you find food trust me you will find it. Identify potions and scrolls early on as its important to know what you have. Use all potions that are unidentified at the end of a level  and all scrolls that are unidentified at the beginning of the next lvl. Different strategies work for different classes so make adjustments to how you play just like any rpg. Please download this game and don't give up! You will get past the Goo I promise. Stand in water while fighting to wash away his caustic ooze and use an earth root for added protection. Good luck!!

Review 3: This game  for obvious reasons  is very reminiscent of the rogue or hack or nethack ascii based games of yester year. I really enjoy playing it. However  I'd really like to see 1) more likelihood of food to eat. Whether by more drops of """"mystery meat"""" or rations. Food issues are woefully out of balance IMHO. One great thing about the nethack games of old was the fact a lot  if not all  the critters who died left behind a corpse to eat... Sometimes giving strange abilities. (just throwing that out :) ) 2) the ability to save the game under filenames would be awesome! That was one thing some the ascii based games had before that was ever a thing for computer gaming back in the day. I'd love to see that here. Those are my two big issues. Love the game! If you have not played it  download it now and have some fun. HINT: always use the """"?"""" option. That will tell you tons on what to do as you explore.

Review 4: I love this game  I can play it for a few minutes on break at work  standing in line or i can play it for hours while i try to fall asleep or i'm waiting for my cue to pop. I have yet to beat the lvl 15 boss... but i've made it there with a warrior and mage... still having trouble with that little rouge... I cant seem to beat lvl 10 with him... but i will... one day  i want to see his mastery! I would say get this game if your easily enteratined  the map  pots and scrolls change every time you start over. Warriors will always know a pot of strength  mages a scroll of identifay  and rouges seem to like maps. There is some other cool little perks about the classes  but its better to figure out as you play. I'm giving it 5 stars... cant wait to see what lvl 16 looks like  or the huntress for that matter.

Review 5: This is simply the best mobile game I know. It is simple  but complex; unwinnable  but fun; brainy  but simple. It is extremely addictive  but it does not take up too much time if you keep a minimum of self-control. The graphics and the visuals are minimalistic  yet they do not make me want to vomit all over the place (as do a lot of games and apps with way """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""better"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" graphics). The interface is simple. There are no ads (and a game nowadays deserves three or four stars just for that). There is a couple of clones that try to add interesting features  but here the balance is perfect. Thank ypu  and keep it up!""""

Review 6: A hidden gem  a game true to itself and what it wants to be played as. It's loads of fun! The game at first was extremely difficult. It had me dying at floor 3 every time. Although I died a lot I was determined to reach at least the first boss...eventually I did  but I was completely destroyed in the first few moves. I realized something after a few more tries  that I had learned new skills I could use in each new playthrough  I saw that I was progressing as a player  not my character. this is genius  the player is the one gaining experience  becoming a better dungeon crawler by mind  not XP.

Review 7: Holy ****  this game is addictive. It's amazingly fun. But holy ****  this game is needlessly difficult. I consider myself to be a very solid gamer  and this game knocks me on my ***. Luck is a huge factor in this game  but even more than luck is knowing every intricacy of the game. If you don't play perfectly and have very good luck  you won't get anywhere. I give the game a 4* because it's extremely fun and the replay value is extremely high  but I know a star off because it's just way too hard. Don't let that discourage you  though... It's extremely fun.

Review 8: Best Game On Android! Please add more levels! If you find this game excessively challenging  that's because it is! If you ever get the Amulet Of Yendor  as I have after a year of playing  you will feel like a boss! The Huntress-Sniper is the best class  your upgradable boomerang your only ally. Search every blank tile  use weightstones to keep you boomerang from breaking  save three magic mapping scrolls for levels 22-24  save a potion of paralysis for the burning fist & rotting hand  and have a battle-wand for the Eye at the end. Play till you win!

Review 9: Hated the gear degradation at first but.. When the game added degradation  I started playing Pixel Dungeon: Shattered instead  and while that was fun at first  it also became pretty easy quite quickly. Further  Shattered also felt a little bloated; I felt like rather than surviving the dungeon  I found myself farming and self-sustaining rather than the urgent need to finish the quest before my resources ran out. I went back to give the original Pixel Dungeon and found it so much more exciting and challenging. Though  degradation should be optional.

Review 10: A challenging  pixelated master piece. I have always been a fan of pixelated style games  and more so for dungeon RPG exploration type ones. Pixel Dungeon blends all my favorite flavors together quite perfectly to create a simple yet challenging  risk-taking  and loot finding game  that has striped me countless hours  and turned it into rage hard fun. This is one of the best yet simple games I've played so far. Much love for this game and it's awesome developers  hope to see more updates with tons of new stuff if possible. 😊 p.s. it's on PC too",7599,The game is very reminiscent of the rogue or hack or nethack ascii based games of yester year.

com.willhauck.linconnectclient,Positive,"Review 1: Works well This works quite well and is lightweight on the phone. I've installed the server on Ubuntu 12.04 with no trouble  although some fiddling needs to be done if you want the notifications to properly appear on a Gnome desktop (upper right corner with the rest of them). ** In answer to yycode: I had to install a Gnome extension to get the notifications to display in the upper right hand corner. I don't think it's anything you can control with the way Gnome is currently set up.

Review 2: Working Great! (Until Yesterday) I've been using LinConnect for a long time now  and then all of the sudden notifications start showing up as seemingly random strings on my desktop. Icon shows fine  but replacing the notification title and description is a set of random letters and numbers. Other than this  I love LinConnect for displaying for accessing notifications from somewhere from the desktop :D http://i.imgur.com/fsz669o.png

Review 3: Decent  but too early of development. I will rate it 4 stars when the development becomes more defined. This is too early to tell  everything works  but its too simplistic. I ran it on suse  deb  fedora  arch  slax  just off the top of my head and no issues  other than my own forgetfulness enabling ufw access after updates and selinux binding.

Review 4: Fantastic application I would request few features for server 1. Ability to have multiple accounts for multiple devices protected by password. 2. Can we have some remote control for device from server? Its fantastic app.. We can also have plugins to make it an open source mightysms clone :)

Review 5: Essential I honestly don't know if I could live without it. When I'm on my computer  I usually wear headphones  so I'm usually not able to answer calls. However  Linconnect changes all of that  and fits my workflow perfectly.

Review 6: excellent app Just works. (especially good with recent-notifications indicator). Server side needs some fixing and might not show notifications with percent values in text.

Review 7: Works great. You need to enable Notification Access for linconnect in Security settings in Android. Would be 5 star if you can also show notification text as well.

com.zaren,Negative,"Review 1: Does what it claims; and that's the best that can be said. I don't have the time it would take to describe all the ways this app is disappointing.

com.zaren,Positive,"Review 1: Cannot manually enter IP for device Auto detection of the device is great if all of your network is fed by one WiFi router. If you have a larger or more complicated network setup to allow the WiFi network to access the wired network then you need an option for manual IP entry. Not complaining because it is free and I applaud the developer's effort. Just be aware it only works on very simple setups.

Review 2: Great for pointing the antenna Superb app for showing all the facets of digital TV reception - signal strength  signal to noise  and most importantly  symbol quality. Some channels with great strength and SN ratio have intermittent symbol dropouts that otherwise wouldn't be noticeable until viewing. This app shows it all. If you've got an HDHomeRun  you really should get this too.

Review 3: Great app to adjust the antenna! This app is very helpful in adjusting the antenna remotely. The only thing I could possibly find missing is the frequencies being tuned to. The app on the computer does show that when it scans though. Sometimes when the signal is less than 100% but still green the whole bat goes green.

Review 4: A little buggy but worth its weight in gold I just installed an antenna in the attic  in August  in Houston. Needless to say I didn't want to stay up there long. This app let me measure signal strength from my phone while in the attic adjusting the antenna. I couldn't be more grateful.

Review 2: This app hasn't been updated in over a year. I wonder if the developers are even listening anymore. I have used and loved SMS Backup+ for years  but since installing it on my HTC One M9 running Android 6.0  it isn't working correctly. First  it wouldn't restore all of my old messages. Fine  they're still stored in Gmail. Not a huge deal. But now the process of even backing them up has become rife with bugs. It crashes almost constantly during automated backups. I have to run it manually every so often to make sure messages are being saved. I would have moved on to other alternatives by now  but I want (and haven't been able to find) something that uses Gmail like this one does  as I love having all of my texts searchable in that format. Please fix this app so I can update to 5 stars  as it has long deserved.

Review 3: Wish I Had Known... I performed the setup  but not the Initial back-up DURING the setup.. I wanted to adjust the Advanced Settings FIRST  which seemed logical... Unfortunately  the post-installation instructions which popped up stated that the ONLY Way to get a thorough back-up  was to do the initial back-up during the setup.. which seems ridiculous... Those instructions go on to say that whatever message weren't backed up can NEVER be...

Review 7: I love the program  it makes keeping all my SMS messages going from someone who switches between phone  and when I upgrade to a new phone. I only give it 4 because  admittedly  doing Restore is a pretty tedious process. To the best of my knowledge  there is no way to simply find the new missing messages to restore instead of restoring ALL messages first  If I switch SiM cards  and want to keep my SMS updated  I have to wait for my phone to go through every SMS message I've backed up to catch the ~30 that are new and missed from my other phone. It's a small thing  but it get's annoying.

Review 8: Slow and misses many messages This prgram shows lots of promise - i like the fact that all my sms ate now in Google mail as a sub folder. However i have 4000 messages- the backup took 90 minutes despite the MB of this cache of data is trivial. The most frustrating points are however that counted more than 4000 messages  backed up only 3500 (stopping completely twice in the process) and restored only 2800 or so leaving the last 8 weeks of massages behind.

Review 9: Can't backup again if we make backup once Hi..... I want to suggest something.... That is when we delete a message log from gmail why it can't make the backup again???

I've switched from Samsung to LG (2nd Galaxy phone died just weeks after warranty ran out :-( I had SMS & MMS backed up to my Samsung account but LG won't access it!

Then use SMS Backup+ to backup the texts to my gmail account....took awhile  about an hour (3800 SMS & about 750 MMS). The App creates a folder in gmail called 'SMS' and you can view/read all your texts there...but that's not the end! I also installed SMS Backup+ on my LG and backed up all the new texts (about 2 months worth  200 texts) to my gmail - and the app appended older texts from the same contact with the new texts (wow!!). Then went back to my LG and did a 'restore' (follow the simple directions) and voila! All my texts are in my LG phone (back to 2014) with the new ones combined with older ones - sweet! I'm impressed  thank you Jan Berkel :-) <3

Don't get me wrong SMS Backup & Restore is excellent but as a technology enthusiast who switches phones like underwear I seriously wish this was in my life earlier. Having all your SMS and MMS messages backed up into Gmail labeled """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""SMS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is the best thing ever. Completely searchable  all MMS / attachments on the original messages in the threads  perfect! Great way to leave behind moving messages only to make your phone slow and full from years and years worth of messages. I just backed up 42 572 messages  not going to look back! App also can be scheduled to do incremental as well  if it pauses / hangs in backup it continues where it left off so no worries about duplicates if your like me coming with a ton of messages.""""

Review 3: Enjoyed this app  but have a request I really enjoyed this app. It worked very well!!! However  I forogt to clean out my call log list and my txt messages before I backed them up. I had no idea that this app would NOT allow me to back-up my stuff a 2nd time. I know that I cannot be the only one  who has ever needed a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""DO OVER!!!"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" It was easier to clean out my gmail account copies of my call logs and texts than it was to do them one-by-one. What i didn't know  was that I could NOT do this a 2nd time!!! I would like to be able to use this app more than once  if needed!!!""""

Review 4: Any backup and restore app is only as good as the """"restore"""" part. This one does the job  but not accurately  let alone perfectly. Example: it restored all my SMS and then some(!). It turns out that it restored even the SMS that I had deleted on my phone. In other words  even though I updated  the app never really synchronized again with my phone. It also restored my call history (which is a great plus)  but it added a red color date on the missed calls  in other words  as if they were never retrieved. If the developer can solve these issues  then it's 5 stars for sure.

Review 5: To everyone who has problems with automatic backup on Android 7.0 Nougat: 1) go to Settings > Apps > SMS backup > Data usage and switch unrestricted data usage ON... 2) then go to Settings > Battery > three dot menu (up right corner) > Battery optimization > drop down menu """"""""""""""""All apps"""""""""""""""" > SMS backup > Don't optimize > DONE. Now auto backup is working again. You're welcome. PS: it is tested only on my Nexus 5X. If you have a different model and/or altered OS  then write the review here to let everyone know was it successful or not.""""

Review 6: Must Have App On an old phone I had a crap load of texts that I didn't want to delete but had to. I went online for an app suggestion to back all of them up and your app was top rated. My last phone took a dump on me and I couldn't find your app on the market. Ended up downloading the apk online somewhere. I love it that much. When I first installed it to this day it has backed up 9815 texts. I never had any problems but every once in awhile I get an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I/O ERROR"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or something like that. What is that all about?""""

Review 7: Small  efficient  and very useful I started using this app way back on my Google G1. Back then  it did not yet have the ability to pass along the dates to make sense of conversations as they all came into Gmail with a timestamp of whenever it synched up. It didn't yet have the ability to pull down attachments in MMS messages. To be honest  I didn't care because there was nothing else like this and it has only gotten better since. I consider my donation as money well spent and hope this app continues to stick around at least as long as I do.

Review 8: ULYSSES a.k.a DJReddBEATZ Yes!  its about time u guys  bought back the app. And I see u guy did an update and it has a NEW LOGO to. I did see the app no more. But its back. I tried the other apps  and they are CRAP. It was a WASTE to DOWNLOAD those apps. I'm glad that u are back. So now I don't have to worry about missing my back ups no more. I can set it to 30mins and and it will backup my CALLS  TEXTS  MMS with no worry. So I recommend this app to anyone that's looking for a good backup app THIS IS THE ONE. DOWNLOAD IT NOW!

Review 9: Simple & Superb ? ?? Managed to recovery important messages from years back (Moto Razr  Moto G and other devices without external micro SD cards to export to) also can now backup/restore whenever I want or simply schedule for instant (1min - 30min) or backup every 24hr. Also supports call logs and MMS too (I get some folk will have privacy issues  but hey if your reading this the NSA/MI5 know who you are...?) Lol ? That fact that this app does its job very well indeed I felt compelled to make a donation which I did. Regards

Review 10: Irreplaceable I use this app to maintain a log of every SMS/MMS and call made to or from. The call log backup function syncs with a separate calendar I created in gmail and all messages are automatically stored in a folder by contact in an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""SMS"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" folder. All of which are accessible within gmail and easily searched if needed. Everything works in the background  it doesn't drain the battery  and it has yet to fail me in the five-six years I've used it. In my opinion  this app is simply perfect.""""",6371,SMS Backup+ creates a folder in gmail called 'SMS' and you can view/read all your texts there.

Review 3: Most calls don't connect Nice ui  but the messaging/call part is inconsistent  mostly not working. Using SIP as backend is bad idea because it is ineffective p2p. And please do not mention upnp as solution because that is an insecure setting that the user cannot always control and is not applicable to mobile data and many other scenarios. The only working scenario was on the same lan or vpn(although on Android vpn via mobile data wasnt working either regardless of manual setting of the vpn device). Also the phone was very hot 

Review 4: Be sure to limit background data for this app in your Android settings after installation *especially* if you're not using the app regularly. Not sure if this is intended behavior or not - I may file a bug report on it as it consumed 16GB of mobile data in a month.

Review 5: Finally Encrypted calls and chat Finally encrypted calls open source app that is not left by the developers and not collecting metadata but app keep crashing on android calls still very buggy and slow also add online status

Review 6: If I wipe my phone before making a backup I lose the account for good. :/ I have the SIM card  I have the username and the password  but I can't restore my account. Keep it in mind before making it your first messenger.

cx.ring,Positive,"Review 1: The update deleted my shared contacts  it works well  but can take a while to connect an audio call  video seems to connect more quickly  also not able to delete sent texts. Gboard works great allows voice to text. Still needs work  and 'lists' email address not working. Keep it up  only 1 of 2 P2P comm suites I've found (the other is unreleased alpha). Love 'no trust' concept. Runs in background ALL the time  no issues with data consumption  as others stated. Running Ulefone Power Andy 5.1 (still) not updated to 64 bit yet.

Review 2: Amazing idea and implementation but huge battery drain I really love Ring's design philosophy  and it seems to work very well. I have been able to test out its basic functions. However  it uses huge amounts of battery and so I can't recommend it to anyone. I understand that this may be an effect of the p2p design. Maybe the phone charging and connectivity state could be detected and certain p2p functions enabled or disabled accordingly? I really want this to work!

Review 3: Everything is starting to come together nicely. It just needs message synchronization and a backup plan for transferring accounts to a new device for when the existing devices that are logged in are non-functional. Some issues could be solved by creating an optional server application for Windows and Linux PC's that would manage message synchronization and offer a backup authentication method.

Review 4: Complete & decentralized communication The ring team is working hard to iron out the wrinkles in this app. They are making huge strides on the best decentralized communication available!!

Review 5: Lots of potential behind this app. Could be setting a new standard. Let's see how ambitious is the team behind it. Love your work  guys...!

de.blinkt.openvpn,Negative,"Review 1: A superb bit of kit. I'm using this instead of the official ExpressVPN app to automatically bring up and tear down my VPN connections. This is because the ExpressVPN app doesn't expose any intents  so connections can't be automated using Tasker. Using OpenVPN for Android and the Tasker OpenVPN Plug-in remedies this deal-breaker. This allows me to automatically disconnect from ExpressVPN when I connect to my home wi-fi (because the whole house is already transparently routed over ExpressVPN via the router behind the cable modem)  and reconnect again when I leave the house and revert to mobile data. You can even select which apps should make use of the VPN  so you can have  for example  a US TV profile for Netflix  Hulu  etc. and a UK TV profile for the BBC iPlayer  ITV Hub  All 4 and My5. The only thing wrong with this app is the lack of a Donate button to reward the author. Please fix this immediately!

Review 2: Far too complicated to use. Am absolute nightmare to set-up and I am IT trained to high degree. Steer well clear. A normal IT person would usually find it fairly easy - but by lord  this app manages to make even that job a nightmare. Regardless  if this app is supposed to be aimed at & used by the average user  they are up against it in just trying get their head around its set-up - before they even use it - if the rare odd person can. NOTE: The write-up for this app doesn't say that its for specialist users - nor presently  does it direct ordinary users to another simpler version? I suspect now that might change?

Review 3: No Process Running / Aunthentication Fail App works most of the time  but some times it stops the connection and shows """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""No Process Running"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". It happens mostly when I change from LTE to WIFI and vice versa. It would be nice that instead of stopping working  it tries to reconnect again automatically  so it is not necessary to always check for that and reconnect manually. Also  sometimes somehow the authentication fails and connection closes. I have to reconnect manually. If auth fails  also try at least once to reconnect and not close connection.""""

Review 5: Quite good but... When importing the profile from ovpn file  the path to the certs is not set correctly as it cannot find the certs when trying to establish connection. The interface is a bit confusing as there is for example no Save button when editing the profile (all changes are saved automatically which doesn't allow to cancel edited changes). Long press on the profile item should provide options to Delete  Edit  Connect/Disconnect. The Log button should not be displayed on the Settings  FAQ and About tabs.

Review 7: Tried OpenVPN and no go but OpenVPN for Android works Tried OpenVPN from OpenVPN and received a no go for an unsupported option (fragmentation) but OpenVPN for Android works seamlessly. It told me clearly which option was not supported and just ignored it. Great work Arnie and it is amazing that the original makers can not do better. Must be because they have commercial interests.... Samsung did not implement a proper OpenVPN client as on the Google Nexus devices...

Review 8: App crashes when not being used over night Since the latest Samsung S6 update this app has crashed a lot of times when the phone is either being charged or not being used. This only happens over night however and I have saved screenshots of the logs to send to Arne. Ive already sent an email and have yet to get a reply. If there is another email address I can contact Arne on to resolve the crashing issue that I will get a reply I have no problems sending the logs.

Recently after upgrading the app on my Note5  the app would constantly crash. Since it was working fine on my Tablet  I decided to re-install with the intent of contacting the developer for help. The re-install fixed whatever the issue was however  and my VPN settings were still there after the re-install  so I did not have to put them back in. Results may vary of course.

Review 2: Works on Android TV (Sony) Best OpenVPN Client on Android so far. Works on my Sony Android TV like native Apps. It is shown in the TVs App menu and is fully controllable by the TVs IR remote. Only drawback: instead of going to stand by  the TV shuts down completely when pressing the Power Button (only if connected to VPN). Next time I turn it on I have to wait until it is booted. I could not find the App in the TVs Play Store. Should be placed there. I installed it from apk 0.6.60. I too use it on my Phone. Great Stuff! Thank you.

Review 5: A requirement OpenVPN is a MUST have if you're a VPN user. It's dynamic & works well. There's a reason it's become the standard. This app allows more options than VPN Connect which makes it a requirement for those looking for more customizable options on mobile devices. Thank you Arne Schwabe!

Review 8: Allows overriding connection settings  network and fallback options. Very configurable and stable. From current offerings  found this to be the most stable OpenVPN client. I've had an instance running continuously for over 30 days without having to reconnect myself across networks.

Review 9: Love it I like it better than the other one. Works as advertised. Where's the one tap? Aha jk! I haven't had a issue with randomly shutting down probably because I don't use a ram optimizer. Be sure to add to ignore lists for those sorts of apps. Thank you sir!

Review 3: Was decent... but now dead. This app has been maybe slightly less frustrating than most podcast apps I've tried. Sounds funny  but there are too many options (for me). I want simplicity and a clean UI without too much hassle or tweaking. **As of 12/24/16 it no longer works. At. All.** I tap to open... it closes immediately. Reported issue. Everything it states last update fixed is actually what's happening NOW. (Wasnt before.) Will try another app for now & try again later.

Review 4: Good but recently started having issues Great but some problems just arose. 1. I can't scroll through an episode. The 30 second forward/back button doesn't work. 2. Jumping to the middle with the scroll bar will work once but it just jumps to a random place that doesn't match the scroll position. It won't respond to any other junior after that. 3. The episode won't stop playing. The pause button won't work. Closing the app won't work. I have to force stop through settings.

Review 5: Not deleting old episodes UPDATE: Dec 27 - The problem I had was that new episodes weren't being DL because the old ones weren't actually being deleted from my phone. Even tho I set it to delete played episodes and they were still on my phone but not available through this app unless i re-DL the file. Need to manually delete the files using a file manager. *****DEC 26 2016. It's not downloading new episodes suddenly. I thought I should update it but that didn't help.

Review 6: Podcasts won't start - Update: Podcasts Vaporized UPDATE: podcasts started playing and things were good and then poof  all podcasts and subscriptions disappeared with no recovery options. Emailed support two weeks ago and got no response... Lame. /update No podcast would start playing whether I tried streaming or downloading. I could tap play and pause and scroll the timeline  but the podcasts would not play. Also podcast thumbnails didn't load. Pretty frustrating.

Review 7: Works but.. I have never been able to get the automatic downloads to work. And after the last update all my podcasts play too fast. Not extremely fast  but just enough to be annoying. I have disabled sonic player and it makes no difference. What is really weird  is the podcasts start out really fast  but after 10 or 15 seconds they slow to almost normal  but not quite.

Review 8: Can't Disable Lock-Screen Skip Button Overall  it's kind of a cumbersome app  but does well enough. A huge problem for me the inability  despite changing the settings  to disable the 'skip' button. I've lost my place in countless podcasts when my phone gets triggered in my pocket and the button--that I CANNOT remove--gets bumped.

I tried a lot of others since Google abandoned thier Listen app and this is the best replacement in my opinion. Nice looking  functional interface.

Very granular settings  which I like. But easy enough to operate while driving or walking. Playback speed is still in beta as of this review but has been working fine for me.

Review 2: Simple  sleek and intuitive Since moving to android from iOS I've been looking for a decent podcast app. After searching the play store  online reviews and top 10's then trying them all out I was still disappointed. Ads  cluttered layouts  and complex apps were all I found. However in a comments section I saw this app recommended  and I must say its great. Not just because I couldn't get on with the others but this app is easy to use and manage your subscriptions and episodes  has a good layout that's both aesthetic and user friendly.

Review 3: Great free/ open source/uncluttered program Great program - free  open source  uncluttered and does the job. One small feature request that  of course doesn't diminish the above  but would be highly sensible and  judging from discussions online  there seems to be philosophical resistance to considering unfortunately- in particular. some podcast subscriptions  such as planet money  sometimes require manual download of a podcast; would be very helpful if these could be organized in and played and kept track of from the program as well.

Review 4: Very smooth and smart UI Simply the best of the free podcasts players out there. It doesn't have a splashy UI or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""fancy"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" extra features -- just the podcasts you want. Easy to stream or download. Unlike some plays who use their own databases or RSS feeds  this one pulls straight from Apple podcasts! No more will your favorite podcast be unavailable to you  if they upload to iTunes (almost everyone does)  you'll have perfect updated access to it. I recommend this player to anyone new or old to podcasts.""""

Review 5: Great podcast manager I use this application on a every day! It has a clear and simple UI with some advanced option such as the automatic download of new podcasts and automatically erasing old or played podcasts. I suggest two improvements: the podcast search only shows the top US podcasts. enhancing the podcast search  improving the suggestions  filtering by language or display related podcasts would be a great plus. The second point is the sync possibilities. So far  you can only sync through gpodder that times out a lot.

Review 6: Simply (literally) the best! With the latest update this player leaves all the others in the dust. Paid and unpaid. No esoteric resource hungry featured. Incredibly stable. Good looking working perfectly for a podcast addict like me. This is my most used app. It's playing 6-12 hours a day! It never ever fails and with the Sonic player built in it sounds great even through my high end ear buds. I really want to pay for this app! For me it's worth double digit dollars Try it. Love it and move on. This is THE player right now!

Review 8: Pretty good. Works pretty well  except for a couple issues. 1) Despite the option being selected in Settings  the play/pause controls do not persist when playback is paused for other audio. I also wish the controls persisted after playback is ended  so it is quicker to jump back into the app to select a new podcast. 2) sometimes the app glitches out  and plays the audio in the background  with no way to stop it. Press play/pause will result in two instenses of playback. I can't reproduce the issue  but it has occured.

Review 9: Skips and stalls After a recent update I have found a few problems when one episode has finished and moving on to the next. The playback stalls and freezes and plays intermittently  and won't allow me to 'come out' of the episode. The only way to do this is to close the app itself and open it again. Having said that  I have tried a few podcast apps on my android phone and this has suited me better than those up until the recent issues  so I will probably continue to use it and hope that updates resolve the problem

Review 10: Awesome This is freaking great. I'd been using Google's Play Music app for podcasts which works pretty well but had a few issues. I started looking for a new app when a podcast I wanted want available on Play. I've used Stitcher before and find it annoying  but then I found this and I'm very impressed.

de.eidottermihi.raspicheck,Positive,"Review 1: Simple and useful utility. I think this app's elegance is in its simplicity. It presents everything about your Rasp Pi on one screen  and isn't complicated to use. The only suggestion I'd make to the developer is - try to make this app more Material Designed  with better themes. Also - allow some custom actions or commands to be programmed by the user for controlling their Pi. Otherwise  I'd give this app five stars.

Review 2: Great App! This is great for when you have a pi in a hard-to-access location. You can simply swipe down and it will give you all the details u need to know. Or u can look at the widget. Hasn't failed me yet! And its AD FREE!!!

Review 3: Great App Been using this everyday to manage this from my mobile and it's amazing. And with the auto updating widget it just so much better! Greatest application to manage the temp  usage  and uptimes of your pi.

Review 4: Ssh credentials fail Other then the broken ssh credentials  the app works great. The option to use ssh keys causes a hostname time out for me.

Review 5: Best App out there  so far This is the best App I have found which gives some Standard info and allows for a quick reboot or shutdown.

Review 6: Cool app Very cool little useful app for running commands remotely and checking stuff such as the ip adress and memory or cpu usage

Review 7: Useful Extremely useful but could do with auto refresh would be even better but all round a brilliant app for just what I need

Review 8: Understandably this is a Android limitation It would be super if this could resolve address.local names in a future update.

de.j4velin.pedometer,Negative,"Review 1: Great simple interface for passively tracking  but it misses steps  doesn't save data beyond a week  and doesn't count in realtime. I tried this after hearing it was tailored to the Nexus 5's built-in pedometer  but found that it still seems to come up short. When manually counting steps it seems to miss about 1 every 25 steps  and this corresponds to being a few hundred short by the end of an average day (~10 000 steps). Admittedly  this is better than most apps... but there are nonetheless other apps that seem to miss fewer steps. Another major issue is that it only tracks steps for a week  not saving the full record. And a minor annoyance is that it doesn't seem to count steps in realtime... rather  it seems to bulk-update after some unknown length of time. So I'll wake up and walk a mile to work and it'll read only 7 steps when I sit at my desk  but sometime by lunch it'll jump up to a couple thousand.

Review 2: Started out bad - got worse When I first launched it  read zero steps. Took 30-40 steps to test it and it read 65 556 steps! Tapped the counter screen and somehow it went to over 131 000 steps. Tried to reset it through settings  but apparently you can't do that or its not obvious. It also somehow affected my iMprint fingerprint reader. Trying to unlock my phone with it failed most of the time with this app running. Had to uninstall it.

Review 3: A little problem This app works fine on my nexus 5 so I install it on my sony xperia C3 dual  which AIDA64 says it supports step counter hardware. Actually  it works well in the first day. But since yesterday it doesn't count steps anymore. I don't know why. I can open this app but it just doesn't function.

Review 4: Really good app the best pedometer I ever used But when I updated my phone to marshmallow  it totally stopt working  if I start the app  it freezes up the phone and causing a soft reboot. Hope someone already reported this.

Review 5: Sorry Was ok until last update. U should be proud of yourselves for fckn up something working fine...go figure...cheers... +++working again after last update. Let's wait and see???+++++not working.... Alrdy removed it...

Review 6: Not very useful Can't change settings. I'm going to use an old pedometer that attaches to my belt from the era before smart phones. Ever since the upgrade to 6.0 I hate my smartphone-nothing works right.

Review 7: No longer counts This app worked fine for a while and I liked it  but for the last month it has refused to count any steps at all  no matter what I do. I am uninstalling.

Review 8: Not tracking I have it turned on. But it will not track my steps properly. Even lowered my step distance and didn't fix it. It told me 3 steps when I did about 50.

Review 9: It won't sync with Google fit. The steps record is not the same with the Google fit app. The app is already connected with Google fit

de.j4velin.pedometer,Positive,"Review 1: The best! I'm using this app for a long time! It is the best and simple app that counts your steps and don't even drain battery at all! Also the developer is a great supporter! I contacted with him 3-4 times with emails for some bugs  which he solved them! Yet i want to see this app more attractive  like if you click advanced  it will show you some new feature like GPS  altitude  barometer  calories etc

Review 2: I'm amazed what this app can do with a tiny 1.4 MB (the size it occupied on my Nexus 5) what other Apps achieve with many times that size. I'm equally impressed by its accuracy: I compared with a brand name App over five days and found it to be just as accurate. And lest I forget  it's also very frugal in consumption of the battery. Kudos to the developer for all these achievements.

Review 3: One of the best  almost I have tested many pedometer apps and I really like this one  I would use it instead of Google Fit  but there is one issue  the pause button. This ends up pressed by mistake sometimes and then I lose tracking data. I would never pause this and would like an option to show or hide the pause button or choose to pause from within the settings menu.

Review 4: Almost perfect. If only it saved data for more than a week or would be what I use. Now I gotta wade through a bunch of crap alternatives to try and find one I like almost as much as this one purely to get a better history. Expand history and I will be happy to reinstall this app.

Review 5: Works perfectly I have been using it since I had Nexus 5  so it's been awhile through 3 phones by now... and it just works. No fuss no muss  this is just one of very few perfect apps out there and Im writing about it just because I wanted to thank developer for his work.

Review 6: So far  so good. I was using Google Fit until I found out about the Pedometer app. This has a much cleaner footprint  and significantly decreases battery drain typically associated with GPS/Accelerometer based step counters.

Review 7: Great app; great support This app does EXACTLY what I need with no apparent change in battery draw. So good for me that I sent the developer some beer money!

Review 8: Light weight... low battery usage Would be good if the notification bar status count updated more regularly. You need to close the app for it to update!

I 200mb lost. I I want to know what this POS has done and where the trash is hidden!!!

Review 2: Does what it says. OR NO? It won't do what it's supposed to do without installing some other lame app. I moved an app  restarted and the app was totally gone from my app draw. Not displaying it on installed apps neither. It may be lost somewhere in my files or permanently deleted. I WISH I HAD A LOWER RATE LIKE -5 !!

Now it boots properly  and even a systen restore launches ZenUI setup (genius lol) Thanks. Currently no firmware released to flash for certain device yet or an update may reinstall later.

Review 5: I love this app. I could fix a problem with my Weather Provider by installing it as a system app. I have a question  though. When you move a system app to user  it disappears as if it's not installed. This you state in the description here  that's ok. But where did the app go? Do I have to delete it manually? Where?

Review 6: Worked great for me Galaxy avant Kitkat 4.4.4 running Cyanogen 11 was able to convert all open gapps to user app. Of course this kind of manipulation won't work for every device/kernel/os do a backup before you try anything as things can go very bad. I did not encounter any issue so i guess that's worth a 5*

Review 2: STILL isn't working right Update: I have emailed you as well and this app is STILL not working! You say that gps doesn't need to be on  but it won't auto-connect to saved wifis. I paid for this to get additional addresses automatically connected  but--while the app does turn off the wifi when leaving an active address  it isn't turning back on when entering a known address. I thought the great thing about this app is that it doesn't require gps to remain active. Defeats the purpose if you have to keep gps on constantly.

Review 3: B.R.H. BEWARE! I installed this app because I thought I would be a good idea  wrong. I couldn't find a way to adjust it  so it turned my wifi off every 5 minutes. I got to the point that I was blaming the phone  I'd forgotten about the app. All of a sudden I remembered the app  and uninstalled it  happy days no more wifi switching off. Whilst I was trying to solve my problem I uninstalled all my app killer apps  no joy until I got rid of this app. Sorry developer only 1 star. Anyway wifi doesn't use much power.

Review 4: Great for WiFi only tablets... ...but on a phone it could cause you to use more data since that can't be shut off by an app - and on an Android 6.0 device (phone or tablet) it's not as useful because apps that you don't use for a while are automatically put into """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""doze"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode and can't go online.""""

Review 5: Can you please add capital letters  I'll give you 5 starts. Edit: sorry  I just don't like it that your sentences don't start with a capital letter  because it would look nicer. (look at the settings on your phone  every option starts with a capital letter  just for style). But it's not very important.

Review 6: Not working properly Whether it's not connecting automatically   or I might not understand how to auto connect it. The network it shows are different than I get available network in my phone  not even manually connect it w/o password. It's totally useless app for me.

Review 7: Trys to turn off and on It trys to turn off the wifi on and off but every time I have to hit allow. I've looked into the permissions and I can't have it automatically accept every time. Not that automatic if I have to hit a button each time.

Review 8: it has a mind of its own. I have tried setting it to turn wifi on during certain circumstances and it just seems to do what it likes. The location feature doesnt work at all. pretty rubbish app and have tried it for months.

Review 9: Wanted to like it I've been using this app for sympathy a week on my G4 and it doesn't work. It won't turn Wi-Fi on or off no matter how I have it set. I was really looking forward to this app. Maybe it's just my phone.

If there was a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""turn of every x hours"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option  i could have used it perfectly.

Review 4: Perfect I use this while playing Xbox because i dont want wifi on while I'm playing  but then when i do pick up my phone during a break I will automatically be on wifi. Worked perfect on my note 4 but now on note 7 its having a hard time because of wifi setting on this new phone. The option to keep wifi on when plugged in is what sets this app apart from the rest because i want it to backup my information at night when it is plugged in.

Review 5: Good simple app ! If we analyze users complaints  we find that Wifi on/off should be made advanced similar to programming logic with priority order for different options  AND/OR logic for combinations of multiple options  then it would become perfect advanced app. E.g. Wifi off at night  on in morning daily  off during specified office hours due to restrictions i.e. multiple on/off time setting. Wifi on at home during weekends.

Review 6: I just wanted an app that would automatically turn on my Wi-Fi when I was at home & turn it off when I left my house so I wouldn't have to remember every time. This one did the job  took me a moment to figure it out but it does exactly what I wanted it to do. There are also several other options (rules) you can set for this app in regards to turning on/off your Wi-Fi. Nexus 6

Review 7: This is a great app! I use an automation app called Macrodroid to automate many similar power saving tasks on my phone but because I've had some issues with it disabling my WiFi even when I was connected to a router I ultimately decided to keep this app for that single feature. I've used this for over a year already and have had no issues with it so far.

Review 8: Love it. This feature should just be built into phones. I Love automation. Come home and it turns on and connects. Leave any WiFi and it turns off automatically saving precious battery. Once you set up the rules it functions by itself with no need to toggle anything. It just works. Why don't phone's do this by themselves.

Review 9: Good app I don t honestly know why  but I had problems accessing my wifi router  i had to reset it all the times when i wanted wifi. With this app  the problem is solved. Also  i like the idea of automatically switching off my wifi when screen is iff. No ads so far and no bugs/crashes. A must have app. Thanks guys

Review 3: This app is enjoyable  but it is very hard to get the volume right without feeding back. Also  the voice modifications are limited. Is it possible to combine the effects by choosing  rather than selecting one alone? Thanks for the work put in too.

Review 4: recording option is there a way to record? also  if there's a way to control what points get detuned  and to what notes (like what all pop vocalists do with their vocals now days)  I could give it 5 star!

de.mangelow.network,Positive,"Review 1: Superb! Great Job by the Developer!!! This is a unique and an only app on the play store which gives you the option to choose 'WCDMA PREFERRED'. The benefit here is it always chooses the 3G network only if it is strong else it hooks on to the 2G network. This helps me to use 3G internet without having to get out of network since it immediately chooses 2G network if 3G is weaker. I have also observed that If you choose WCDMA Preferred and if you make a call then it chooses 2G network automatically and gets back to 3G after the call ends.

Review 2: Moto g first gen - all good now This app saved me buying a new phone. Thank you to the author. Odd bit of info out on the net pointed to this but with either misleading info or out of date. Checking on the net for tech names for 4g and 3g enabled me to get 4g sim working in gen 1 moto ( 3g only ). Again thanks to the author.

Review 3: Awesome Having a problem with network on my Moto G first gen. I had to restart the phone to get signal. But this app helped me resolving the network issue without restart. Only thing is  I need to keep switching the network type periodically to wcdma preferred because it automatically changes back to GSM auto(prl).

Review 4: Truly  a life saver! I flashed CM12.1 on my SGS5 since it's a lot fluid than Samsung's TouchWiz LP but it seems that Google has removed the option to lock network mode on WCDMA only.

Review 5: Worked on nexus but not on Samsung note 5? I loved this app when it worked on my nexus 5. Superb and very handy but it just doesn't want to open on my note 5. Not sure why that's the case but would appreciate if the developer could fix the issue or advise me.

Review 6: Good app But my device is red mi note 3  using VoLTE network but my devices is not rooted   using as network disconnection switch but after this switch network works good for 20-30mins. I don't know what is this actually but this good

Review 7: Worked great! I have a rooted Atrix HD running CM 11. I had very slow connect speeds with AT&T LTE  so I installed this app and selected 3G  connect speeds went up 10X! AT&T has some real problems in the SF Bay area.

Review 8: True problem solver It really helped me when my smartphone's network connection showed only 2G signal while the network provider had 3G or even 4G. This app really a problem solver.. ???

de.onyxbits.remotekeyboard,Positive,"Review 1: Yes  it's a rather geeky app and you need to have a telnet client  such as the command line one Windows comes with that you can get in """"Turn Windows features on or off""""  or PuTTY. But once you connect to it  it's very straightforward to use. Just type into the terminal window and your keystrokes appear instantly on the Android device. If you can't figure out telnet  there's another remote keyboard app out there that uses a web interface  but you still need to enter some numbers in a browser to connect. (Or buy a bluetooth keyboard  it's simpler still.) I prefer this one because I like the simplicity of telnet and like the """"send to PC"""" button at the bottom right of the phone screen  to send whatever's in the text box to the PC. It's a great way to get URLs out to a PC (or send a bunch of text up to be processed with a regex and then pasted back to the phone) while you're using Remote Keyboard. Manual ROT-13 encryption is a strange feature to include  but alright I guess. I'd really prefer if there were an option to have real encryption  either with telnet over SSL (if the user can puzzle out how to create such a connection)  or even better  SSH.

Review 2: Nice. Works great for the most part. I love the no-lag connection when using my PC keyboard to type in WhatsApp and the stock SMS app. The one drawback is navigation functionality  which could use some work... For example  I can use CTRL+Q to back out of a WhatsApp conversation  and then I can use up/down arrows to move around my current conversations  but there is no way to actually enter into a different conversation! With my stock SMS app  on the other hand  I can select a conversation from my list of current conversations and enter into any one with my keyboard ENTER key; i can then back out of that conversation using CTRL+Q  but at that point I'm completely frozen! Up/down doesn't work anymore  CTRL+Q doesn't work anymore...so I'm forced to pick up the phone again. Still the best remote keyboard app I've ever seen  though (: (I think step-by-step installation instructions would be helpful to those who have no experience using a telnet connection  by the way.)

Review 3: Finally :) ok  gotta give this app 500000 out of 10. First app that I have used on Android that actually lived up to its description AND then some. I purchased a bluetooth keyboard for my tablet  and it's pathetic. doubles the keys  some dont even register  laggy.. but this app? one small telnet session? and it works! I was dubious. but it's great  and if only shift+arrow keys allowed you to copy individual letters out of text  it would be perfect. I am amazed this works so well  terminals are now a pleasure to use :) Cheers!

Review 4: What a neat app. I am using it to write this review. I installed puttytel.exe  which I found by a Google search  on my desktop. First I click on the app remote keyboard  choose remote keyboard as the keyboard  then I click on the puttytel.exe on the desktop with the settings described in the app  and it does work. You can save the settings as default settings so you don't have to enter them each time. So a few clicks and I have the remote keyboard working. Thanks for this app.

Review 5: This is life! But how can I use this device when my laptop use the phone's tether hotspot? Anw  if I may give some personal advice or something that I want more for this application  which is I can select a conversation for example with my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Enter"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in my laptop so I don't have to touch a conversation in the gadget. I think it will be a good thing (for me). But I very very like this application. So love it  thank you so much for creating this :D""""

Review 6: This is SUCH a useful app! I use it every day at work as well as at home. I've even included it in my startup batch script haha. Using the keyboard via USB is a little trickier than via WiFi as you have to enable debugging on your device and also have to use ADB to forward a port to 2323 from the computer  but this process is very easy to script as ADB is a command line tool. 5 stars because I haven't had a single problem with it yet!

Review 7: Absolutely indispensable app to save hours of Your life! Simple  but impossible to live without once you try it. You missed one HUGE improvement though. The app is small so the best way to implement it is to let it sit in the background and switch the remote keyboard on when it receives a TELNET connection on port 2323. This way I could just telnet in and start typing instead of having to open the app and select the remote keyboard.

Review 8: Really handy ! A more secure option would be nice. Great for when your in a pinch  and  for whatever reason you need to enter some long strings of text into your phone. (eg. command line interface  or an app that doesn't support copy+paste). It would be nice if a more secure option than telnet was utilised  but  when used on a private network this isn't a problem. (5th star for not needing to connect to some online server!)

Review 9: Well done! Thanks! The only trick is figuring out how to connect telnet: 1) Install telnet in Windows (do a google search to see how) 2) BEFORE connecting  select Remote Keyboard as INPUT METHOD. 3) the letter """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""o"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" followed by a space  the IP address  another space  and the port you see on your Android Remote Keyboard app. 4) Voila!

de.onyxbits.textfiction,Positive,"Review 1: Smooth  polished  and the text-chat interface concept is a brilliant idea that is very well implemented here. I grew up in the 1980s playing these Infocom titles  and while I go back to them every so often as an adult  I've yet to get that same feel from mobile Z-machines (such as Son of Hunky Punk  which otherwise is also good). The chat-text interface here is the perfect transition to modern mobile platforms for these games  and I'm frankly amazed that no one had thought of it before. As others have mentioned here  the only real point of frustration I have is the lack of .z4 support  which eliminates later classic Infocom titles such as A Mind Forever Voyaging. But for about 70-80% of Infocoms and virtually anything produced in the Inform era (post-1997 or so)  this Z interpreter is just spot on. I'm giving this five stars  because it deserves it  even without .z4 support. With .z4 support  I'd be petitioning Google to make a six-star rating possible.

The only things I'd like to see changed are listing the score and day/time (in game) on the main screen while playing (as this is important in some games)  and correcting the issue of double enters with just one """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""enter"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" press when using a bluetooth keyboard. I found a temporary fix for the latter issue by selecting the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""auto collapse keyboard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option under settings  but this makes it so I have to manually select the text entry field every time before typing - annoying  but better than the program interpreting one press of the enter button as two. Still  a great program with lots of potential. Thanks!""""

Review 3: Really great z interpreter!!! Easily the cleanest and most responsive I've seen  the smart interface takes a little of the tedium out of the command line only interface. Love it!! I only have one issue: When I use my wireless Logitech 920 keyboard over bluetooth  for some reason every time I hit enter  it issues 2 enter commands. As a result  the engine first interprets my command  and then an empty green bubble appears  to which the interpreter responds  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""I beg your pardon?"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" If that little fix could be made  it would be wonderful! Great product!!""""

Review 4: Library directory options please Really nice app. Only thing keeping it from a higher rating is that I cannot designate the path for the game library. My device has very limited storage space and it would be extremely nice if I could store my game files on my external micro SD card instead of having store everything in the internal storage of the device. Edit: gave an extra star cause I got a new device. Still think adding games is a bit fidly and would still like library path options.

Review 5: hopes for IF on touchscreen Save State dialogue is text entry with no dialog or previous entry recall. Could use text scaling and some other additional formatting and layout options. The borders trigger movement so on a small device this may affect your scrolling. Alternatively  it's about the best hope for now of playing IF on a touchscreen and seems to do a fair job of at least interpreting the compositions and making them a bit more accessible with its toolbar.

Review 6: Great! A very good version. Tested so far with Zork and Hitchhiker's Guide. Interface is nice to use  even on a small screen due to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""click existing words"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Two comments: save before changing focus! Sometimes your progress will be lost... Also  using the back button to remove keyboard to read the game text; if you double click you'll be back at the z file selection and will loose progress. Saving and restoring works via the menu.""""

Review 7: EXCELLENT Z Interpreter! This is the BEST interactve-text shell program I've run across that is for Android. It is fast  responsive  intuitive and makes interactive fiction that much more fun because of one-key entries and icon selection actions. You don't even have to use the keyboard for most of your action commands. It is a very well thought out format and game-play method and allows you to just focus on the game. Excellent app that I would recommend to anyone.

Review 8: I've tried a lot of z interpreters  and this is my favorite because: * It's well laid out  and text is easy to read (not miniscule unicode) * Useful shortcut buttons (examine  take  open  etc) * Ability to click on a word in the story and include that in your command. The only thing that could make it better would be a user-defined library location  rather than the """"download"""" folder only. It's a lovely interface  though  thank you for the app.

Review 9: This is a great app! I love this app so much  I especially love getting my friends to help me along the way except I can't save my progress. I don't like starting from the beginning I'd love to be able to put my phone down  think about where I am in the story and be able to come back right where I left off and try any solutions I've thought up. When ever I click save it says Saved but I don't see it in my library...what's up?

Review 10: Best of them all. I've tried several apps that play z-file games and this is by far the most intuitive and user friendly interpreter by a long shot. I'm not going to mark it down for not being able to handle glulx files because even now there are none that can. Twisty claims to be able to  but it doesn't work for me  at least not with the game I've tried anyway. This is a definite keeper. Very  very highly recommended.",5749,The text-chat interface concept is a brilliant idea that is very well implemented. The only real point of frustration I have is the lack of .z4 support which eliminates later classic Infocom titles such as A Mind Forever Voyaging. For about 70-80% of Infocoms and virtually anything produced in the Inform era (post-1997 or so) this Z interpreter is just spot on.
de.ph1b.audiobook,Negative,"Review 1: Works fine but I wish it had more features. 1. Different skip amount for forward and back (like Audible). When I skip forward it's usually to find a certain spot in the book and I would use 30 sec or more. When I go back it's usually to hear something that I just missed and I would set it to 5-10 sec. 2. Optional book-timeline. In an audiobook I do not care about chapters and I don't care if I'm 5 min into chapter 7. I want to know that I'm 55 minutes into a book that is 7 hours long. Looking at timeline chapter by chapter gives me NO idea how far I'm into the book! For now this is my player for non-audible books but I'll keep searching until I find a player with the features mentioned. UPDATE: No longer works for me! It needs access to my SD card but when I select SD Card it still shows internal storage. Other apps seem to access the SD card just fine.

Review 2: No speed up any more I purchased this long ago for the speed up functionality and the author removed it on Lollipop. I recognize that he said it was buggy  but it worked fine for me and now this app is worthless unless I maintain an old version. An option to turn it off would have been far more reasonable. I'm also really concerned that he didn't mention this in the app description as well  so unsuspecting buyers will not have the primary functionality he advertises in the app description. Plus no ETA on getting it fixed. Fail.

Review 3: Please add disable bluetooth at end of sleep timer Almost my first choice. Wish the app could disable bluetooth at end of sleep timer. Save my bluetooth headphone battery. I'm sad that Dev has rejected this feature request raised by another user. Love the simple design of this app and don't think one extra tick box in the setting page would over complicate the UI. App is A++  just gutted by the missing feature. Using another app to do this. Why is it so hard to have this feature integrated in any audiobook player.

Review 4: Good Interface  Minimal Features What it does  it does well. One thing I don't like is the file management. I have my library organized by author  series  and then the books. I can't select a root folder to add (my master Audio Book folder)  otherwise it thinks the sub-folders are their own book. My suggestion: having it maybe show the sub-folders  and then clicking the folders shows the next folders  kind of like a music management  where you click on artist  then album and such.

Review 5: I have been using this app for the last few years  and it's a great one. The scaled down interface is wonderful! I'm downrating it just to let the developer know that there is an issue that has started since the last update. Audiobook files will only play for three minutes at a time before stopping suddenly. This continues every time you pause and un pause. It has gotten very annoying and I very much hope you fix this error!

Review 6: WTF?!?! It used to be an almost perfect audio talk player which actually organized files correctly. However  since the newest update the playback speed disappeared! Thus  for me this app can't be used until this function is returned in a future update. If it doesn't anytime soon  I'll be deleting this. Now I have to go on an app hunt to find a similar player that can adjust speed and organize files appropriately.

Review 7: WTF?!?! It used to be an almost perfect audio talk player which actually organized files correctly. However  since the newest update the playback speed disappeared! Thus  for me this app can't be used until this function is returned in a future update. Until playback speed adjustment is readded  I'll be using Maple Player Classic. I suggest that as an alternative to this player for those needing speed adjustment.

Review 8: The only reason for one star is to get your attention!! I change to 4 or 5 after a quick response from you. When listening to a book and a call comes in  the audio playback does not resume after the call ends. I listen to books when I drive and also receive calls during my drive. Every time I have to resume the playback manually. It's distracting when driving! Please please fix or tell me you are working on it...

Review 9: I use it a lot  but... There is this problem with the covers. If I put an audiobook with a cover  then the rest of the audiobooks have the same cover  even though some of them have their own. It is annoying. And once it deleted my library and I had no idea on what part I left my audiobooks at. But it is useful. If anybody knows how to change the cover thing  that would be awsome!

Review 10: looks nice  doesn't work On nougat  it seems to be impossible to play from an arbitrary position. dragging the slider does nothing  it always starts at the beginning. hence useless for me. book is a simple mp3 on the sd card  maybe one of the two is the problem. File corruption is excluded by the fact that it plays fine in other apps. I recommend Smart audiobook player.",4951,Deph1b.audiobook is a free audiobook player for Android devices.

de.ph1b.audiobook,Positive,"Review 1: Great app. Five Stars. I use this several times daily to listen to audiobooks while walking the dogs and how brilliant not having to go hunting for where I last stopped the story! I do like the variable speed adjustability....it's the no. ONE feature for me because I like listening a lot faster than they read. { So I won't update until that is fixed for Android 5 ...in fact as the ap works so perfectly I don't see a need to update at all..? maybe I would risk an update for an EQUALIZER to boost the treble up a bit....but so often adless apps get 'improved"""""""""""""""" with ads that if something is brilliant like this I turn updates off!} GREAT WORK.😉""""

Review 2: It's great but would really appreciate it if you could make it more mp3 friendly. I use this app to listen to long mp3 files mainly because off the easy rewind and fast forward feature. It's difficult finding mp3 players that allow for single tap rewind and fast forward for long audio files. I know this app is designed for playing audiobooks but I think it would be really nice if it had better support for long mp3 files. For example  having the option of seeing individual mp3 titles as well as grouping mp3 files by album into books and to be able to order them by title etc.

Review 3: Really good  perfect with a couple of extra features. Love this app  simple and elegant. Would be a 5 star review with a couple of extra features (I'll put some requests on Github). I'd love to see a sleep timer option for the end of a chapter. When I finish a book  the progress seems to jump back to the beginning of the last chapter  it would be nice if it marked as complete  maybe even be able to filter the listings to exclude complete. I'd also like to see the ability to cast (this doesn't take away from the quality of the app  would just be a nice to have)

Review 4: I have a suggestion :P First of all I love the app.. Been using it for months and it's really easy and simple to use and it also looks gorgeous! :D But I do have one feature I'd like implemented.. The option to sleep after a chapter ends.. I usually use audio books consisting of a lot of chapters in different mp3 files.. So a feature to sleep after finishing a chapter (reach the end of an mp3 file) would be very very nice to have! Thanks for reading! I hope this'll be a new feature sometime soon :P -Andreas O.

Review 5: Almost perfect If it only had the ability to go back  like 10-15 seconds  so if you missed something  you could hear it again...The only way with this app  is to drag the timeline progress bar  and that isn't as convenient or precise as the short review arrow provided by Smart AudioBook Player. The Smart app also has a nice shortcut on the notification bar  so you don't have to swipe a few times to get back to your book. Neither one automatically resumes after call interruptions like Ambling Book Player.

Review 6: Bluetooth Priority I don't know if this is the place for this but  is it possible to add a bluetooth headset priority to the app? When I press play off my bluetooth headphones it always chooses a different music player. It also prioritizes that music player if it's been idle for 10 minutes or so. I don't know if this is something that can be added into the app or it's an Android OS or phone thing. I'm using LG V20 Android Nougat with LG tones headphones. Best Audiobook player out there!

Review 7: I absolutely love this app. It's extremely minimal and easy to use  it remembers location for any and all books you are listening to. Except with the most recent update  any newly added books won't save the location after my phone turns off. They also won't start playing until after I start playing another book and then come back to the new one. Updated rating: Fixed. Updated updated: can no longer change playback speed  main reason I use this app.

Review 8: Great app - bugs with latest updates though 😥 I've enjoyed using the Material Player app for the last year and a half. The user interface is very clean and intuitive  which sets it apart from many other audiobook apps. Unfortunately  I have experienced issues on my Galaxy S6 with the latest updates which has made the app extremely buggy and effective unusable. If these can be resolved I am happy to return to using and will rate 5 stars.

Review 9: I'm a heavy 'audiobook listener' - and my ageing Sandisk Sansa Clip was a very good audiobook listening device. However  since the really good & small MP3 players aren't being made anymore (or the newer line of Sansa players aren't as good anymore)  I was looking for an audiobook player app for my smartphone. And thanks to Material Audiobook Player  I found it. It's good  no-nonsense  and perfectly sufficient for my needs. Thanks  Paul!

Review 10: Simple to use  works perfectly Only missing a star because scrubbing through tracks can be fiddly to stop at the right place  especially in longer files. I've seen other playback interfaces where the further you move your finger from the timeline (once you've touched it) the less time the marker moves in relation to your finger's movement. Be nice to see something like this implimented in the future. Otherwise  this is a great app!",5202,Deph1b.audiobook is an app that plays audiobooks on the go.

de.qspool.clementineremote,Negative,"Review 1: Used to be 5 stars  but this app is now completely useless because the developers have removed the support for versions of clementine older than 1.3. So for anything such as a QNAP where the apps are controlled by a central repository  this client is now unusable  and the older one is no longer available.

Review 3: I recently tried to download over songs from my music library from my PC to my phone using this app. The copy process was very unreliable. Many songs did not copy and there was no alert or error. Several times the app crashed when pushed to the background so I had to keep the app awake while copying but even then many songs did not copy. Can the dev team fix this?

Review 4: Its not connecting with laptop I have installed clementine version 1.3.1 on my laptop and then installed this remote on my samsung core2.....i enabled network remote control also....then i tried all the 3 ip addresses it was showing me on the first screen in phone...but it is still not connecting...pls suggest what to do

Review 5: Now completely useless. Lack of support for older versions of Clementine has made this completely useless to me. Really sad it was one of my favorite apps. And of course given the ecosystem there is no official way to downgrade the app.

Review 6: Doesn't connect my Samsung S4 to my Lenovo with my music. My router has a VPN set up but assigns 168.101.x.x. to the devices within network  and other devices can talk to each other behind the VPN. But this app doesn't work.

Review 8: Demands permission to make calls -&gt; uninstalled I'm not going to grant random apps privileges to make phone calls. Refusing to continue without the feature to silence music during calls is ridiculous.

Review 9: The remote program requires Clementine 1.2.1  but for Linux users  Clementine's latest version is only 1.2. Even though Clementine 1.2 has a 'Remote' options page  the remote won't work with it.

de.qspool.clementineremote,Positive,"Review 1: This Remote app allows people to control Clementine from their Android device. What is Clementine you might ask? It's a free and open source music player that has a great wealth of features  and is available on the 3 major OSes. Thus  you require Clementine to use the Remote  but it's well worth it since it's a fantastic music player. You can do simple tasks like control the music with this app  but there are a few more things you can do all in the Remote. You can do playlists  search your library  get song info  and even download music to your device. Clementine Remote acts as a great companion to the standard Clementine player. Clementine on its own is awesome to use  and the Remote grants extra usability from the comfort of your Android device.

Review 2: Really good! Just selecting song is sometimes funny I donated a pizza as this app is really good. I just miss an """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""help"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" section. Select a song and play is sometimes not easy.

It seems that the choice of a song is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""random"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". You clic a song and another one will play. Duno why. 5 stars anyway cause the app is stable no crash and the connection over wifi is very simple.

Review 3: Way Happy! You never know that you are missing something until it comes along and This is a game changer for me! A little primitive in the look and feel department yet I don't know how I lived without it. I would like to disable Album cover from my Galaxy Tab2 lock screen media controls because I have a great family pix there  Also the volume does not appear to work from the lock screen?!?!? Job well done. I love Clementine almost as much as Amarok1.4 which is no longer supported by Ubuntu/Mint 17 so Clementine rules (for now)!

Review 4: Clean and Fast  Almost perfect! This remote app works really great with Clementine on my Macbook Retina Late 2013 Edition! :) It is very fast  almost instant and has a nice  flat and clean interface! We can even control the music playback from the lockscreen  which is really sweet! The developers are receptive and follow user suggestions. Speaking of which  Please add the option to seek from lockscreen. Also  dowload playlist feature is the best thing ever but sadly it is still buggy. Kept getting Storage Not Found error!

Review 5: Extremely useful  but... The app is just amazing generally  it just has a couple of quirks that happen sometimes that don't exactly ruin its functionality  but they are slightly annoying. For example  when the screen goes to sleep and I turn it on again  or if I exit the app and open it again  it will have reset to the first playlist instead of the one I'm on. It generally does that  like when browsing the library  entering a folder and then going back it starts at the top again. Otherwise perfect.

Review 6: In Awe This is by far the best app I've ever encountered. 1 hour ago I thought I love Winamp  but there's got to be something better out there. Searched Google...found Clementine...saw the word remote...sounded a bit too good to be true...installed the program on my desktop...tinkered with it a bit...playlists and all that...got the app...1 min config...ended up with a remote controller for my music...in awe. Thanks for the app. :)

Review 7: Works beautifully! You need to open whatever port you have set for connection  in your firewall (the app default is port 5500) and set your IP address for your local system that you wish to connect to  and you're done! You can download music/playlists on to your device via the remote and all. :-) No Advertising Bollicks  and it just does exactly what it's supposed to do  beautifully! Thank you so much  to the developer/s! :-)

Review 8: Really good but add a sort by album option to the library This app is awesome  really good  works really well and is very stable. The only problem I have (and this is a bit of a pet pieve of mine) is that I can't sort by album. I usually don't bother sorting by artist as I have so much music by different artists that it takes ages to find what I want so an option to sort by album from the remote would be much appreciated

Review 9: Nice  lightweight remote to an already amazing player I've been using Amarok/Clementine for years now and this just makes it that much more useful. While being able to control the music player while you're away from your computer is useful  I find myself more often using the app to browse and download songs from my library. Sure  you don't need a custom app to do this  but it does make it that much more quick/convenient.

Review 10: Now working Keeps telling me to upgrade to 1.2.1 while 1.2 is the last one on the site of clementine and in ubuntu 14.04. I would love to use it :-( [Update] You need to use the developers version to get it to work on Ubuntu 14.04  now to find out how to control it from Wear ;-) Use the developer PPA and upgrade  all is well (i needed a dist-upgrade before it installed)",5145,Clementine is a free and open source music player that has a great wealth of features.

Occasionally I open a menu unintentionally. But the game itself is great

Review 2: True to the game The function of the game is consistent with home gameplay. I love the graphics  animations and gamepiece manipulation as well. My only critique or suggestion would be to include device to device multi-player ability. This functionality and user interface is not the easiest or friendliest

Review 3: Much like Blockus. Good mindless entertainment. I've not been bombarded with ads...alway a plus. Occasionally  I get a stone lost off the board itself. If you enable the back button to replay a move you will solve this. It will move the stone back to the rest of the pieces to play

Review 4: Addicting Don't download this game if you don't have enough self control to keep yourself from playing it all the time....just like Blockus and the computer you play against is actually really good and it makes it challenging. I hardly ever see any ads in it and its so addicting.

Review 5: Really well put together  but the scoring is a little confusing. It correctly scores based on the number of individual squares claimed  but displays more prominently the number of blocks left over  making it seem like that's how the winner is determined.

Review 6: Please Read.. This is my favorite board game Would be great if it was more difficult  i win every time and have to make up challenges for myself  great game but will go tired if we can't incoperate another game difficulty. Otherwise fantastic game ?

Review 7: Functional and Fun Love how easy this makes the strategy to pick up. Now I can see how to win the """"""""""""""""real"""""""""""""""" game instead of being reactive. I appreciate that it only takes a few minutes per round  unlike other games I have installed.""""

Review 8: I like the sound effects  but wish for more features Clicks and vibrations make this game enjoyable  along with the dimensional artwork. There is AI  but the number of computer controlled opponents is either 3 or nothing.

These steps to ensure proper use would be outlined in bold at first available reference to user intending proper use and to gain anything from this app. Therefore  the intentional allowing of a majority of first time users followed by requesting information from their phones that should never be shared with 3rd party operatives such as yourself leaves the conclusion this info is being solicited for devious purposes.

People complaining about """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""spyware"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" are idiots (w/ one appearing schizo w/ an axe to grind). RTFM  it's simple.

Software is HARD; stop bitching.""""

Review 3: Does NOT support SPRINT. I'm not quite sure how this app can somehow NOT support one of the top 3 carriers in North America -- SPRINT -- but it does not. The app leads you to believe that this can be corrected by submitting your carrier's details  but this is a false hope. Have tried for months now to have Sprint added  without success. If the app's author would list a major detail like this in the app's documentaion (like not supporting specific major North American carriers)  it would be a very useful  helpful thing.

Review 4: After looking at what information the app can access on my device I think it is spyware. Apps don't actually need permissions to work  permissions are a legal trick to allow third parties legal access into your device. I have no complaints about this app needing root  android is a very insecure os and google should be ashamed of themselves for setting up this system which is renowned in the cyber security sector for letting malware through to the google play store and on to your devices.

Review 3: Cannot pass parameters Doesn't have the ability to pass parameters to activities. Can't set custom activity actions - would be good to have presets for common actions such as android.intent.action.VIEW. Without this the usefulness of the app is reduced. Starting activities is also possible with many custom launchers such as Nova Launcher but they don't provide the option to set parameters either.

Review 6: Was great once before  now in need of major update. The cache size for the application is very small. Loading more than 400 activities causes the app to crash before the entire app activity list is generated. Has not been updated in over a year. Uninstalled.

de.szalkowski.activitylauncher,Positive,"Review 1: You saved my life. I recently bought the Huawei Mate 8 L29 and for the hell of it  Huawei has decided that users do not need dual billing cycles for dual SIM phones. Thanks to your app via a post in XDA  I was able to access and set the data limit via the stock Android Marshmallow data usage UI. I use Apus launcher. Can't seem to add a shortcut.

Review 2: Exactly what I was looking for. I wanted to make my own shortcut to get to a setting that normally required 4 steps to get to. Now I have a shortcut on my home screen that opens directly to it. Plus the process of making the shortcut was simple. No ads. And the scope of the shortcuts you could make was way beyond what I was expecting. Nice job!

Review 3: Great Very useful appp to access apps that are still in development  are not accessable in your country or just to learn about your phone. Warning! This app could be a security flaw on some phones  because you can access surten settings without needing to enter code/gesture/pin. (Right now on LG V10)

Review 4: Awesome! Finally able to launch sub-applications packaged within an app  like ES Media Player that comes with ES File Explorer. I love that shortcuts can be created & customized  including icon  for the home screen. I also love that it is open source (available in the F-Droid repository).

de.ub0r.android.callmeter,Negative,"Review 1: Very Complex Even after reading the faqs and by setting mode of billing by trial and error  i am unable to get correct stats. This app needs a easier interface specially for dual sim phones. My operator charges my calls by per minute. For eg if i called someone for 30 seconds  i will be charged for 1 minute. If i call for 1 minute 12 sec  i will be charged for 2 minutes. Now tell me what settings i need to do under mode of billing or anywhere else  so that i can get correct minutes i got charged for. Will rate 5 after.

Review 2: Yes  it controls your bill someway but Configuration is not user friendly at all and interface can lead to some confusion to configure and get precisely information. App has some obscure bugs and doesn't allow to account short billing periods (e.g weekly and daily). Also it is not possible to disable data billing  although it works well. Updates are not frequent and app is somewhat outdated

Review 3: Data counter inaccurate with S6 The 4G data usage counter has been inaccurate ever since the Android 5.1.1 update for the Galaxy S6. My data usage is shown as 40+ GB per month when I've actually used much less than 4GB which is my plan's limit. Suspect it has something to do with the VOLTE traffic. Pending update from developer.

Review 4: Awasom app Hi A must have app. But I have a problem while using this app in my another device Xolo q500. The SIM ID option is missing in Rule sets. And thats why app is not calculating outgoing calls and messages. I also tried my galaxy s duos ruleset in Xolo q500 but not working. Please sort out this problem Thanks Dev.

Review 5: Good but Most of provider will charge per block of call. For example  call out for 20 second but it will count as 30 second. Call out 45 sec but it will count as 1 minutes. This software dont have this setting for call block of second. So the counter is not accurate. Will give 5 star if updatebas i've mention

Review 6: Nice but only one issue Dear developer's pls fix the issue or update the problem regarding the call time issue. This app add the two call seconds in to one. e.g. one call 25seconds and other one 35seconds but this app show 1minute call means I use only one pulse of my plan not two pulse.

Review 7: I can not use it anymore as I have vodafone corporate plan I can not use it anymore as I have vodafone corporate plan. Older version was customizable as per my plan but the current doesnt have option to set my custom plan. Uninstalled it. I love older version this version sucks.

Even the most complex of plan can be configured with this app  similar apps dont provide much option and are useful only for some basic plan with flat rate. Slightly hard to understand and configure but once done u can see every details such as local and std calls  roaming ic and og  no.of sms  data traffic diffrent billing rate for diffrent minutes so on so forth. Cheers to developer for making it free.

Review 2: Was a excellent almost flawless app This was working quite good till a few versions earlier. But now with the new updates I am facing a few problems. First of all with 60/60 billing mode it is considering a call which was not even picked up as a 60 sec call and adding it to the widget statistics. Secondly  it sometimes stops working  like it doesn't update the call and sms statistics. It again becomes active after the end of the billing period. Please look into this and give me a solution. I really loved this helpful app.

Review 3: Good for payg Widget shows cost and other usage. Setting it up is a pain. There are preconfigured settings that you can import. This is good with Dodo $2 payg or yomojo payg. You can set up widget to show either remaining balance or how much you have used. Plans have to paired with rules. If there are special numbers  rules have to be paired with numbers. Best app for payg  doesn't have anything to exclude first 200mb or first 100 minutes.

Review 4: Excellent utility. Great utility  it takes a little effort to set up (if you read the excellent built in help first  it's actually quite easy... I read it last  my fault...). Using it with Telstra Encore Prepaid  it shows cap value balance  data balance  cost of each call/SMS  allows for free calls/SMS after 6pm  I like it  and find it very useful  many thanks to the developer. Atrix  Xoom EOS  Nexus.

Review 5: Brilliant but hard to set up right. This app is great  the setup part I mentioned in the heading isn't so much a fault of the app as of the overly complicated billing nonsense from phone providers. As a result to make sure it can tell you everything it wants to the setup process has to allow for many providers all trying to charge us more than we want to pay with overly complicated plans.

Review 6: Very Good (excellent)! Very good app. In addition it have also the Dark theme and adjustable colors and transparency of the Widgets! Good job! DEFINITELY USABLE! IT EVEN DO NOT SPEND CPU TIME IN STANDBY!! PLEASE ADD THE OPTION FOR """"UNITS"""" (CALL/SMS/DATA SUM) BILLINGS

Review 7: Data usage issue? The app is good and i really appreciate the customization options  but would you kindly provide some enlightenment on why the reported data usage is about three times the statistic reported in the built in Samsung monitor of the Galaxy Note 4?

Review 8: Best app ever seen Best app for postpaid users..also supports dual sim and u can exclude free CUG numbers too.. Happy to use this app. You can keep track on free minutes in your phone plan. Little careful if you have free minutes for std n local separately.

Review 9: Magnificent This app accurately counts my calls  text and data to give me a good idea of how I am using my plan. I have no major complaints  just that it can be a bit more customizable; namely  the ability to frequently change when my bill cycle starts.

de.ub0r.android.smsdroid,Negative,"Review 1: I think a lot of reviewers have missed the point of this app. If all you want to do is send a regular SMS though your phone's provider then this probably isn't the app for you. It is most powerful when coupled with WebSMS  allowing me to automatically send messages for certain number prefixes through a cheaper web-based provider. My first complaint is that it could look a little prettier. It's not as ugly as WebSMS but a little padding around the text could make all the difference. Perhaps the developer wanted to fit as much text on the screen as possible but screens are relatively large and high resolution these days. The """"""""""""""""Black"""""""""""""""" theme is also more like grey under the Material Glass theme for some reason. With those two issues fixed  it would look much like the stock Messaging app. My next complaint is that starting a new thread fires up the WebSMS interface instead of allowing you to type into SMSdroid directly. This inconsistency is a little jarring and there seems little reason for it. I guess SMSdroid is simply lacking a recipient selector. My last complaint is a minor one. The multi-select button doesn't actually do anything. All in all  a thumbs up from me.""""

dev.ukanth.ufirewall,Negative,"Review 1: waste of time! I used it for one purpose: to isable Whatsapp when I don't want to get any notifications and messages received would appear to the sender as not yet delivered. It blocks the app to wifi and data  but don' you dare to turn off your phone or getting it turned off due to low baterry. When you do start your phone again  rules seem to not apply or to be very slow to activate   so you get a bunch of messages that now to the sender will look as delivered.

Review 3: best Fan of the best of the rest since day 1. The phone I recently purchased could not be rooted with any headache free method except for Kingroot. Which come to find out is slowly growing headache that reminds me daily of how much I hate and regret ever using in first place. What's with the Kingroot warning  and why isn't it permanently blocked especially if it doesn't follow the rules? Why can it phone any address  bypass any rule  when afwall has equal root authority. Can't something be done here?

Review 4: NEVER DOWNLOAD!! I'm sick and tired of all the bugs that keep multiplying in this rubbish app! And worst of all is that the sick developers take revenge when you uninstall by removing files off your rooted device (to which you gave them access)! These files are required by most other - much simpler - firewalls to operate. VPNDIALOGS was one of the integral files they removed from my device. DON'T TRUST THIS APP!!! AND DON'T TRUST THE DEVELOPER!!

Review 6: This app is a must have. I wish it had the ability hotswap rulesets a bit quicker or at least name my exports... Can't import a rulesets that has had its name changed externally.. Also one time the entire app ceased to function blocking connections  I flushed rules and re applied but didn't do anything. Had to soft reboot to fix. Makes me a bit uneasy.. I'm having to check known blocked apps now to verify its working.

Review 7: Good idea  not quite perfect Sometimes I get """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""error applying"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" notification message  so it's not clear whether it's on or not. Wish there were a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""disable"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" menu option  and maybe a test/indicator for whether it's functioning or not.

Review 8: Im facing major problem. after installing rr5.7.4 MM rom  wifi disconnets after a few seconds. ~10 s. after connected to a hotspot it disconnects and says no internet  cant connect automatically.

Review 9: Feedback Please add a feature to show a notification when an app  that has not been configured  tries to connect to the internet.

Review 2: Great App. *REPLY Excellent app. Must have  one of the first apps I put on any fresh phone. All network based ads in apps are vanished. DEV*REPLY-Toast not disappearing. Not an xposed toast  it's a SU access toast. Downgrading to the latest backup fixed the issue for me.. It's gotta be an xposed module issue in the new version.. Also  no way to uninstall from xposed without a complete AFWall uninstall. So  the xposed install/reboot notification goes nonstop if I don't enable the module. Module should be a separate app  imo.

Review 3: Works fine for blocking unwanted """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""conventional"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" traffic.

Review 5: It's a great app and does its job  and I love that it has a tasker plugin.

But that is not too frequent so I am not annoyed about it that much. I love the profiles and the tasker plugin. Added to mg recommended apps foe privacy on android guide. Thank you so much.

Review 6: Best iptable manager out there  but has some little issues. Export all + import all wont reimport everything (like -12 tethering  1000 system stuff  download manager). Also profiles need some rework (also sort sorts differently for Default and other Profiles). But overall I am happy to have the donation key. &lt;3

Review 7: Great iptables based firewall. Could be slightly better if you could refer to app by number so you could run Debian in the background. Also I noticed an app called engineermode keeps on trying to access Google and a bunch of other IPS. Does anyone know what this app is? Thanks

All this time i thought there was something wrong with my data... wew. But theres nothing wrong. ITS A BUG. The page should auto reset to page 1 when filtered. :) please fix thank you!

Review 2: Jeff is right  this drives me mad... Great DB app  but the Commit is broke when editing data on Tables. I have to edit the table  back out of the app. No changes are saved. Then go back into the app  make the changes again  and this time it prompts me to commit the changes. So 50% of changes are not commtted. Its a horrible bug. Please fix. Otherwise great app. 3 stars till commit is fixed...

Review 3: Mostly it does what it says on the tin. It's a lightweight db manager. However it lacks support for some features like creating a table with constraints. (It's still possible to achieve the same result using a raw query.) Also the interface can get annoying; for example the Edit button can be so small it's hard to press.

Review 4: Too easy to accidently copy to clipboard It frustrates the hell out of me that it keeps copying to clipboard all the time when scrolling. It should give confirmation before copying to clipboard. Simply tapping to copy is really inconvenient because it's far too easy to accidently do so messes up my clipboard.

Review 5: Error when opening database When opening any database  the app returns a error: """"""""""""""""-tmp-mksh: [...] no such file or directory"""""""""""""""". cp did not solved the problem and this phone does not have ext storage.

Review 6: Reinstall problem? I first installed this app to try and manually fix an APN problem on my phone. After continuously running into an error  I decided to reinstall the app and see if I got the same results. This app no longer opens database files on my phone  serious problem!!

Review 7: Ok  but but limited means of dealing with errors Added fields for a new table  but an error in default value for a date field prevented table creation. The problem I found was that I couldn't edit the problematic field without first deleting all field defs after it.

dk.andsen.asqlitemanager,Positive,"Review 1: The app will not open a database file stored on external sd card (and instead of saying so  it gives the scary error message that the file is not a database). Once I copied the database to internal memory  it opened without any problem. User interface could use lots of improvement. Have to use PgUp and PgDn buttons instead of scrolling through all records in a table (looks like this is implemented this way for quickness when browsing through large tables). No pinch-to-zoom in or out. Ability to execute native sqlite dot commands (like .dump and .schema) would be a big improvement. But the app has a lot to recommend it - it's probably your best bet for editing sqlite databases on your android device.

Review 2: 4 stars Useful  unique. But the hardest to use compared to SQLite Editor  SQLite Debugger  SQLite Manager. Term is my daily driver but this feels a bit like the learning curve for Linux back in 1996  its that hard :) Also  choosing Menu→Exit three times when done is exhausting. The shell is a bit slow too. At 1st  I got errors then found in settings that its not recommended to use /emulated/0  thay fixed it. Overall  this one is quite good but usually I'll use better ones (and easier  faster).

Review 3: Great with minimal permissions Useful for examining database and correcting errors. Does not allow correction in some cases. Edit is per row instead of more complex SQL filtering. Would love per data editing by long click/touch of that data. Like the touch to copy data to clipboard feature. Perhaps  long click on data to bring up context menu eg edit data  edit row  etc. Await more customization.

Review 4: Good  fast execution  easy to use. Executes my legacy SQLite queries. Export to CSV is good  but does not export field names (heard that donate version does); does surround text with quotes making data easier to import to other applications. Font size  saving queries etc... all in Options. Would be good to be able to choose light/dark display. Good response from developer.

Review 5: Works OK for what I need Only thing I would like is to be able to clone a field from the previous record in the database without going thru the whole """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""edit field  delete the data  type the new data  save"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" sequence. Something similar to the Ctrl"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" function in Microsoft products on my PC.""""

Review 6: My Choice Of Mobile Editors I primarily use this for prototyping databases I'm using in desktop and mobile applications. I find it very useful in that capacity. Can't honestly speak to its other features  as I haven't really used them  but for easily generating table creation statements on my tablet  it's excellent.

Review 7: Redesign UI for sensing tablet display size. Great app. Type font is too small to read on Nexus7 tablet as default. Please update to sense screen size automatically and use appropriate font size. Other than that  it has a very good intuitive interface. I set the font size to 18 in setup and it's good now.

Review 8: Single most reliable SQLite Editor.. Currently  the only one that is able to edit system databases in Android Lollipop. Others use either PIEs or other invalid invocations of 3rd party tools. This one worked out of the box and is not too aggressive with permissions too. Top!

Review 9: Great Database Manager App Awesome sqlite db app for Android. Clear and simple interface to manage tables and records and run SQL queries. I have added dbs by usb and even connected it with QPython3 for simple scripts. I highly recommend it for the data nerds out there.

Review 10: Interesting & useful Nice & simple. No eye candy  which is refreshing these days & presumably keeps this app light on resources.

Maybe even a premium version with these options..Anyways keep the Updates Rolling Devs n Thank you for the beautiful App👍

Review 3: Love it but... I love this app. Really fits well with my phone's theme. However  it seems that the checkbox for the standard theme does not really exist in android 6.0. Hope you can fix it. Also  when you swipe an item to the left or right  the button for deleting or marking an item as done disappears quickly  so they're pretty much useless. And I also hope that you will allow editing the names of lists in the app. Will be giving 3 stars for now.

Review 4: Love it I had this app on my WP and loved it. The only thing I miss is that this doesn't have a widget where I can view my to do items on at a glance rather than opening the app. This is where I stop using the apps because I am not given that constant reminder. I think it worked with the live tiles on WP. But everything else is great  just keep searching for that elusive widget I want so badly.

Review 5: Great! I'd recommend two things: 1. when you scroll a list  make the plus button disappear (so you could see the items). 2. In a list  when you open the keyboard to write  make the color bar and the 'V' button to raise above her so it will be faster to update an item instead of pushing the forward button to close the keyboard.

It would be great if  when creating a new task  it appears by default at the top of the list so it's easy to find and move when you have a long list.

This firwall was unable to help whatsoever in fact  it seems to have compromised my phone. I know this because I have a WatchGuard Firewall in my network between the modem and internal network so I can see every single packet of traffic on my network. Most people probably do not have such a device as they are used in Commercial businesses usually. Very disappointed. To install this I uninstalled LostNet No root firewall. As old as it is  the LostNet Firewall seems to have done a MUCH better job even though the IP tables lists are apparently dated. I would be VERY interested to hear what the developers have to say in response to this.

Review 2: //Re: author answers are not correct. Either he didn't read comments correctly or is just being evasive.// App interface can be polished more. The main font is too large  if author can't scale it properly  an option should be available; it is disgusting to scroll down big lists of apps. At least add a fast scrollbar. 1. Open-source project for profit. 2. Why it needs to restart VPN for every single change in options? It should wait a bit  either by using a timeout  or waiting user quit Settings; changing many options will toast cpu. 3. Apps icons should be resized with better quality. 4. Eventually it may stay running in background even when it is disabled and app closed; maybe related to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Notify on Internet access"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option; not always reproducible.""""

Review 3: 🚨I warn anyone to buy this app 👆. This app is not working at all in marshmallow 👆and the developer lied and asked me to create an account to answer my question too. After creating the account he lied and didn't answer and he said you didn't pay for support. I already paid for the licences! You are blackmailing us with this app. Remove this app from market and go away we don't want someone who doesn't appreciate our efforts. Your app is not working in marshmallow why you keep laying? We should all report this app from down below the page to Google and ask Google to delete this dangerous app.

Review 4: Hi  I know this deserves a 5 for the features its giving out for free.. but there's a bit of an issue. I am facing 2 difficulties in using it. 1. Its blocking my net completely: probably because I am blocking some system app that controls data access for the device[ASUS ze550kl]. Can u please tell which apps I must not block? 2. One of my SIM is always on roaming  so I need to specifically set """"""""""""""""allow roaming access"""""""""""""""" to every app. Can we have a generalised all-app-generalised roaming on button as well  & a sort by date/blocked/allowed option for comfort?""""

Review 5: A firewall by nature should not connect to anything I don't want to connect to. This connects to ad networks I don't want to connect to  making it a bad firewall. I refuse to donate to the app or purchase any features while it has the ability to connect to ad networks. Reply: Not being able to block connections makes it a bad firewall  a poor rating is not unfair. If you have to make your app bad to be viable  so be it. But I will still rate it by its quality. A bad app is still a bad app  even if it is better than no app. My rating can't be for only the paid version.

Review 6: Lags Android ? 5-10 sec delay upon every lock & unlock. Any playing music is briefly paused  user interaction is impossible until after wait. Haven't changed any of the stock internal settings.. Subnet Routing was already disabled; turning off Filtering didn't help. It's not the VPN  it's the app. Force Stopping the app solves the lag. 'No-Root Firewall' is older  but works fine & is free! EDIT: I paid 9$ in IAP for Netguard  just so I could be told that Samsung is too buggy to be fixed.. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""support"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" at its finest! ?""""

Review 7: Blocks Onkyo remote despite I said """"allow"""" in every way. Occasionally has problems with routing traffic even in small amounts (like banking). After switching off firewall  all is back to smoothness. Also crashes after a day or two. My phone is not a buggy Samsung. It's a almost pure Android (Motorola X Force). It's working  but I would expect a free fully functional app just with ads (not annoying) from Marcel. UI is not nice. No multiple changing options. Now just waiting for more free features  then I'll make it 5 stars.

Review 8: 1st  on reviews you say this can do better than those fancy root firewalls - writing own Linux iptables scripts  top issue is denying breaking in - I've yet to see a no-root firewall saying anything about blocking TCP/UDP ports from incoming connections - can this? 2nd  I use my phone as Wi-Fi spot at home  does the VPN work with it? Edit: since you can enable tethering  I updated this review - but I can't give 5  as I don't understand why you can't block incoming connections  which is what I foremost need firewall for.

Review 9: Flashing ads I understand you need ads to support your project  but is the flashing ads really needed? EDIT : Google is your partner  so I suggest you take it up with them! EDIT 2 : It feels if you are blackmailing me with your flashing ads. Surly you can block unwanted ads on the Google ad network. EDIT 3 : I do not understand your attitude  just block the annoying flashing ads. Contact Google if you do not know how to do it. EDIT 4 :My problem is not with the fact that you have ads but only with the flashing ads.

Review 10: It's working  but has ugly bug which scrolls the app settings screen up while I try to click 'notify about app connection attempt' which i also observed in other app (banking  but poor).

eu.faircode.netguard,Positive,"Review 1: Very nice app. Could you come up with the on off switch designed by checkbox? By that it wouldn't go off automatically  and stay on until the checkbox is unchecked. You can make it better by showing pending access  access log and data usage. For pending access another third option is needed between access and no access  ask for access type. Challenge is not to increase the size  shall see forward to your updates. Grey shirts would have been perfect if only checkbox was used instead of push button. OK  rating is updated :-) you already have a on off switch  slider type. I'm asking to replace it with checkbox  that little box with a right sign when checked  that takes even less space than slider. And keep in mind other possible improvements. No it's that orange slider switch at the front screen which makes the firewall itself on and off. What else your app does other than blocking the connection? Ya  checkboxes cannot be unchecked automatically without human input. That's way I'm asking to use checkbox instead of slider or push button. Everything else can make it better is already said. Shall check out your updates.

Review 2: A huge """"""""""""""""thank you"""""""""""""""" to the developer for this app. It does what other non-root firewall apps weren't able to do. Purchased everything to support development. If there is 1 feature I would love to see  it's wildcard hostname filtering at a global and app level. It's great that this app supports (and reports) all data and protocol usage  supports IPv6  per-app filtering and data usage  logging  packet capture  even subnet routing and filtering based on data network type (including 2G/3G/4G) if some of your networks are metered or you want different restrictions on them. And a speed graph notification bar with configurable history duration. I'm impressed 1 developer has created this - kudos to your skills. Oh  and it's honest AND open source! This is the kind of model we should all be supporting.""""

Review 3: A FREE local VPN that blocks any or All incoming Data? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE? I switched to my alt gmail acc to rate this app twice. That's just how good it is. Your level of care for this app is superb! · I've used 30+ Android devices & 100's of apps  rooted most of them too. Xposed framework was the best way to get the most out of any device. But now that I have a Moto Z Force (Verizon) I lose my root ability. . .I can breathe happily knowing there are great apps like this one out there. Take control of your data for good! I will be Donating to the cause.

Review 4: IDC What you say  BEST FREE open source app I've ever used! So I've been using this app for no more than 5 minutes & I can easily say that this little gem will forever be a part of my app database. ·It guides you effortlessly thru the setup process ·There are multiple ways to use the app  weather it's a simple view or detailed ·Its UX design IMO is flawless! I've only seen a handful of apps made this well & they were all Xposed apps. Sometimes apps get bugs  so do dogs  but this app will end up being MANS BEST FRIEND. Say NO to Data Munching Apps Forever. -Thanks

Review 5: I like the the overall design of the app and the controls it has. However with the firewall enabled I am seeing a little over 100mbps download speeds on my tablet and phone. When the firewall is off I get 245mbps download speeds. While I expect some performance hit when using a firewall I don't expect more than a 50% hit. I have it on a Samsung S7 phone and a Samsung SM-T700 tablet. Turning off the Filter traffic option took care of the performance issue so I changed my review to 5 stars. Thank you to the developer for the quick response.

Review 6: After configuring Netguard  watching it work its magic and reading as much as I could about it  I purchased all of the extra features  with gratitude. Truly excellent software front to back. I've been in computers since 1977; I've learned to distinguish good software from bad over the years. Thanks Mr. Bokhorst for the tremendous effort. It's a shame that most negative reviews are from Samsung users blaming their buggy phones on this dev. Absolutely zero problems on ANY of my Nexus devices  and I have several!!! LOVE NETGUARD!

Review 7: CONTROL TO THE USER A working solution to the problem of apps accessing servers without permission (can't be controlled through OS app permissions). Netguard has with success blocked the stock dialler from contacting Google with every call I make  to send that number to Google (a massive privacy breach in my op). Before this app you would have had to root your phone & install a custom ROM like Cyanogen to get this. A very neat  low resource implemtn. NB Does NOT block ads. WELL DONE MARCEL. Happily Pro Purchased.

Review 8: Perfect The place i work has terrible WIFI that frequently drops out and when it does android happily switches to burning my mobile data which I pay per Gig. I wanted a way to allow critical apps access to mobile data only. As I searched the Internet i found mostly root only solutions. Then I found this little gem that does exactly what I want with no root needed. I tested it and it works amazingly well. This is just what I needed and was so happy I clicked the support developer button and donated.

Review 9: Great app. This app has proven invaluable for keeping me under my data cap. The Android OS ability to pause data usage after a user defined limit is great  but there are some things you just can't afford to pause. For example I wanted to pause everything EXCEPT messaging & phone/VoIP apps  but using the OS controls it's all or nothing. Using this app it was as simple as clicking a few icons and viola - messaging and VoIP with no potential for other apps hogging my valuable last 100MB of data.

Review 10: Most Excellent - but some issues NetGuard is by far the best no-root firewall for Android that I have found. I like the UI and especially appreciate the screen-on controls. I think the all-pro price is reasonable and I was happy to pay it.  I wish I could give it 5 stars  but I can't.  I have encountered several minor and significant problems. I'm compiling a list to submit to the author.

Review 2: excessive reliance on SRV records I wanted to use this with Oracle Beehive XMPP  but the reliance on a specific SRV record instead of allowing custom server name and port is  frankly  counterproductive. If this is the best XMPP app for Android  it should not close off avenues like basic custom settings. This is unfortunate  and so I got a refund. I guess the next stop is Xabber.

Review 3: Good app  doesn't save all settings I have the """"""""""""""""keep service in foreground"""""""""""""""" option disabled because I don't like that it requires a persistent notification  but it seems that option keeps getting reset.

eu.siacs.conversations,Positive,"Review 1: All the features required to enjoy rich content chatting plus the automation of end to end (e2e) encryption. Even though. I have F-Droid  I purchased it here to support the developers =). This app is capable of all the features provided by google hangouts with the added bonus of e2e encryption and far more efficient battery consumption. It is just a matter of configuring your server appropriately to enable the XEPs required to support the features. I'm using eJabberd 16.08 so I can guarantee you that at least the 16.08+ versions support all the features.

Review 2: Works great against a prosody XMPP server. Carbon Copy: works (meesages go to Psi+ and Conversations) Mentions: work (notifications when my nick is mentioned in a conference  quiet otherwise) Notifications on keywords in a conference: not implemented (oh well). Overall it's not as feature-rich as Xabber  but so far it's less buggy and the UI is much better.

Review 3: Great ui but not dependable Please add option for status indicators. I can't tell if online contacts are away.. Also PLEASE fix the constant jabber reconnects. My connection is perfectly stable and no other apps have this issue.. Also would love an option for persistent notification to indicate I'm online in the background  similar to how IM+ does it.

Review 4: Wonderful for privacy and family With ejabberd in a raspberry pi  omemo encryption  no server to server  message archive management  it is great to exchange photos and videos with peace of spirit.. and server backup! Waiting with baited breath for video/audio implementation (there is a bounty for that).

Review 5: Feature rich and well-made Well-functioning client with XEP-280 support and that allows me sending and receiving photos with the people I chat with. Very stable - has so far never crashed on my devices. Good verbosity on showing which xep features that the connected server supports. Nice dark theme.

Review 6: Awesome Jabber IM client! The best XMPP messenger. Period. I love how the developer keeps the development very active and fixes any bugs very soon. With its own desktop version on the way  I can forget about other desktop clients too :P. And I'm waiting eagerly for Real Time Text!

Review 7: Excellent client! I'd love to have Exit button because some jabber services limit no. of clients and I have to force kill Conversations on tablet when I start my laptop or they keep disconnecting and reconnecting. Its not resource issue but server side at jabber.at

Review 8: I can't believe how little battery this uses. It's so lightweight I wonder if it uses GCM. Fantastic  updated regularly and feature packed. I used to use Xabber (which is excellent itself) but this is just so light on battery usage you forget it's running.

Review 9: This is hands down the best xmpp app for android. But note: most of the features depend on the servers  and because it does not require google cloud messaging  it uses quite a bit more battery than the usual messenger app.

The search bar falls perfectly under your thumb  and your favorite apps sit right above it. Best of all  it's open source and actively developed! This thing is fast  light  and secure.

Only one suggestion for the """"""""""""""""green or white circle"""""""""""""""" method call i.e. quickbar or quicklist: have it generate a list of lists; two is good enough  of which each sublist will contain 4 or 5 nodes and each node will point to an app. Hehe.

Review 7: Great concept Really like the launcher. Would be great if it were possible to pick custom icons per app (and rename the app). Also multiple tags per app  so instead of searching for 'Amaze' I could add a tag like 'file manager' | 'files' etc... and search by tag. In fact anyway to add custom entries would be handy.

giraffine.dimmer,Negative,"Review 1: Please note that the impossibility to install an app when the dimmer is active is NOT a bug. It's the Android OS that forbids to do potentially dangerous things when an app uses an overlay over other applications (because overlays are also used to send taps and other messages to the system  and could install malwares or unwanted apps without the consent of the user). All similar apps have the same problem  and it is not fair to give only one star if the programmer is not responsible of that """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""feature"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".

Review 2: nice notification controls! color filter option too. auto dimming as well  but many nice phones have poor  very limited sensors so almost nobody can have high hopes for auto-brightnesd controls. it is too bad other app designers focus on looks before needed features. I would add saving a few custom color filters as presets  with a notification button to cycle through them. I wasted money on paid apps that wasted their features on poor interfaces. this is the only screen adjuster so far with a useful interface. Low memory useage too!

Review 3: Find A Disastrous Bug Using this app from last couple of months but today I find a very annoying bug.. Whenever I go to file manager to install a app  install button didn't work at all.. I was about to visit service center but today while taking screen shot of that very intall option for showing to my friend I just increase the light of my phone to get a good screen shot and then suddenly I click on install.. It started working.. Trying again during dimmer on.. Again it didn't work... But now it's working after uninstall.

Review 6: Good  doesn't quite work inverted This is a pretty good program  does what it claims well. The problem is that I tend to use my device with colors inverted. When doing that  I discover that it doesn't really dim  it only alters the color to mostly black  which inverts as mostly white (while remaining at the same intensity)  so I cannot use it inverted. Plus the battery savings is likely not happening as much as I imagined.

It don't reduce minimum hardware brightness instead use a filter so don't expect a longer battery life. For reduce the minimum hardware brightness try to use GravityBox (only for rooted devices). Personally (on rooted device) I use both : Xposed + GravityBox to reduce minimum hardware brightness (improve battery life) and Dimmer to reduce even more the brightness because the minimum hardware brightness is to high.""""

Review 2: Does an excellent job This kind of app is exactly why I made the switch from apple. At one point I had cut out a piece of car window tint  taped it to my iPhone as it was way too bright. User friendly?! Note if changing text size in the kindle app it can sometimes turn screen super bright. It's a kindle thing  just goto settings in kindle and check 'use system brightness' for some reason kindle seems to attribute the pinch or pull text resize as an invitation to over ride your system brightness and completely blind you. :)

Review 3: It's perfect...when it works. I really like the scheduling  the color filter  and easy adjustment from the notification pulldown. But it turns off seemingly at random  mostly while using the default chrome browser. (not enough data to tell if it's that app specifically or just a limited runtime) So I'm doing some late-night research  and all of a sudden the screen jumps to full-white and about 3x the brightness!!! -2 stars for that.

Review 4: I love it but i tried a ton of dimmer apps and this is the best that i can get but please  make an update on the appdesign itself  it seems very much outdated .. and also have the navigation keys dim too  it will defeat the purpose of the app if you cannot make it dim (im using LG G3 running on 5.0).. but all in all  great job .. WE non-nexus users will wait for the update

Review 5: Slick & easy Really love it  its simple  great  has a easy touch to it  everything you need in such app to be easy accessed. Thank you very much for creating it to be used with such ease  and you other users should look in to this app. Once again thank you  and I hope to see many more great updates from this great app :)

Review 6: Tried a dozen screen dimmer apps  none  execpt this and one other app  would stays in the notification bar to allow quick toggle ON/OFF. The other app is overbloated at 2.5MB and over complicated than need be. Whereas this app is only 330KB  simple and easy. Best dimmer app hands down.

Review 7: I really like the convenience of this app. The app itself is basically a setting  it's the widget is switch. BUT  the widget somewhat looks like Google Keep's icon and the pause play button like a music app. So I hope you could do the change and don't change function. Thank you!

Review 8: Awesome At night I am having problem to read in my mobile phone after I heard about this app and downloaded this first I think that it will of 5 to 10 mb app but it is having only 334 KB app thank you to make this app and I am very Happy ......./******

Review 9: I like the fact that it can... Go below the minimum brightness  which is pretty bright on my 2013 Moto X  but it seems to be drawing more current than it does on auto brightness. I'll test it some more and give my final review. For now 4 stars.

github.daneren2005.dsub,Negative,"Review 1: Great but has a playback bug that really annoys me I love the features on this player  but there is one bug that annoys the heck out of me. Many times  when I skip to the next track on the playlist  there is no music playing even though the progress bar and time is moving along. The only way to get it playing is to press the pause button and then press play again. This happens in offline mode as well as online mode. It didn't always do this before  so I don't know what happened. I've used this player for well over a year  but this problem just started like a month or two ago. *update*: I did try reinstalling Dsub  but after reinstalling  i found that it remembered all of my settings. I found that the playback problem seems to be related to my bluetooth speaker (UE Boom). When i use dsub w/o the bluetooth speaker  everything seems to behaves normally. Very strange problem. Possibly the player stops sending signals to the speaker in between song skips and it has trouble reinitiating when the next song starts? I can hear slight clicky sounds on the bluetooth speaker when skipping tracks.

Review 2: Fantastic Product Constant updates  significantly better feature set than the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""official"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" app and a conscientious developer. One minor problem- since the Lollipop update on my Nexus 7  I'm hearing little electronic pops and buzzes every now and again in the music. To ensure this isn't a data-at-rest issue  I've rewound to the same point in the music and the pop doesn't recur. I initially thought it might be a problem with EQ processing; but  alas  I still hear an occasional pop and buzz with EQ disabled. UPDATE- Music issue seems to be in the Android media stack. Play music suffers from the same issue.""""

Review 3: 5 star app until Nougat bugs fixed.... Please update this app!!! Bugs: Dsub immediately resumes the last song when you first load the app but does not show the song as playing. Then afterwards it jumps to the next song after 20 seconds.. plays that song fully... then it's the end of the playlist. Also sometimes when i load the app it'll start playing 2 songs at once and i can only pause one. I'll have to close to entire app to get it to stop playing. App is totally unusable until this is fixed. Please fix! Edit: Thanks for being such awesome responsive devs. App is working perfectly again. Thanks!

Review 4: Other than having Chromecast support this app doesn't appear better in any way than free alternatives like Ultrasonic. The UI is clunky and the Chromecast-support has so many bugs. To name a few the volume controls never seem to work while casting and if you stop a song and close the app to cast from another app  this app will try to reconnect to Chromecast and override whatever other app you tried to cast from which is really annoying. Even if you stop the current song and kill the app after casting the next time you start the app it'll automatically try to start Casting again.

Review 5: DSub solved my problems! The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""official"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Subsonic app is not updated to cache data to it's own folder on the SDcard  leaving me without 6GB of music for offline listening. For 2 months  I did not know what was going on  struggling with my phone and tablet  never getting to listen to my cache. Yesterday  I finally discovered that KitKat 4.4 locks out writing to the SDcard outside of the app's folder  but the official Subsonic app is not getting fixed  so I found DSub  and now I can listen to offline music again! SIX STARS for DSub!""""

Review 6: better than stock app but... 3.5 stars it's better than stock subsonic app. not sure that I'd buy again. lacks a critical feature that I expected. it pauses when I unplug headphones but unlike most music players it lacks option to automatically resume play when I plug headphones in again. this requires me to unlock the phone and open app to resume play. a nuisance. another nuisance: when playing  widget appears over lock screen allowing me to pause and skip tracks. nice. if I unplug headphones  widget disappears thus requiring to unlock screen.

Review 7: I think the dev just took the free version and modified it. You can see this in the error messages  position of the screen elements  and overall conceptual design. After the new version there are issues with connecting to the server. From my work connecting to my home via the browser it works great. Connecting from my work to my home with the dsub product I get constant time-outs. I can do this back to back within a matter of minutes back and forth. It seems dsub has become unstable and unusable.

Review 9: I like it  but... a few things are annoying. 1) Why even have an online/offline mode  why isn't there just a check if a network link is up? Doesn't Android have that capability? I allways have to remember to switch back to online mode  or the sync won't work and the UI works differently depending on which mode i'm currently in. 2) Why does the creation of a random playlist in offline-mode sometimes take &gt;1 min. when it is instant in online-mode  whether i'm actually online or not?

Review 10: This app is VERY good normally. But after updating to Android Nougat 7.0 DSub drains my battery very quickly (30% in an hour) and heats my phone up to 115+ degrees. I can use other music streaming apps and podcast apps after the Nougat update with no battery or heat issues. Also  the developer has not been responding to multiple emails about this issue  which is in itself very disappointing.

github.daneren2005.dsub,Positive,"Review 1: Excellent subsonic app A.very good subsonic client - easy to use  good layout  reliable. My only gripe is the lack of support for multiple tags in the same field  i.e. tags separated by some separator  for example """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""jazz;free jazz;experimental"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as the genre tag  which should result in the song being found under all of the three genres listed  or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sunn O)));Boris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as the artist field  which should result in the song (and the whole album of the song) being listed under both the artists """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sunn O)))"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Boris"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". This is the way squeezeserver operates and really should be the standard  but I am yet to find a mobile music streaming app that allows this basic functionality. Edit: Changed the rating to 5 stars after a developer reply explaining that lack of multiple tag/tag separator issue is a limitation of the subsonic server itself and not due to app design.""""

Review 2: Love this app. Best Subsonic mobile client that I've found so far...but  one feature that would make this a 5-star rating is: Add a feature to browse offline files via ID3 tag (if this is possible...or let me know if I'm just overlooking something and the feature is already there) I have my music organized in various folders by genre and in certain genres that have a huge number of artists  they are organized in alphabetic sub-folders by artists name (such as A-B  C-D  E-G  etc)  and by only having option to browse offline by folder  it makes it hard to browse my downloaded songs to find what I'm in the mood to listen too unless I remember exactly what I have downloaded and exactly what I want to listen to. I prefer to use DSub  but for offline music  I currently tend to go back to Google Play Music since I can browse offline files easier by just a list of everything that is downloaded and I can scroll through everything. Thank You!

Review 3: The app continues to improve  which is impressive since it was pretty darned good right out of the gate. Easily my favorite all-time Android app  it fulfills a dream I had years ago when I got my first high-capacity iPod -- that I'd have access to all of my personal music collection (which then was a seemingly-absurd 250 GB  and which now is closing in on 2TB)  all of the time  no matter where I am. I still wish stream-of-consciousness browsing was easier (i.e.  that you could tap on the artist name during playback  or even the song name  and have an auto-search done -- as it is  you need to back out to a search field and input your search terms manually)  but I'm so impressed with the app overall that doesn't impact my enthusiastic 5-star rating. Truly excellent.

Review 4: App is good  works well and does what I need. I like the chat feature as well. However I have an issue possibly due to my folder structure but I feel I'm not the only one that does it this way. Media sorted as Letter \ Artist \ CD \ Track  example E\Eminem\Marshal Matthers LP \01 - Intro.mp3 . Within the App I get my list of letters to choose from  when I choose this the app then seems to assume the folder E is an artist and is displaying a blurb about an artist named E. Below is not CDs but the artist names themselves. Not sure if this is something that can be fixed or adjusted but let me know. EDIT: THANKS FOR THE TIP THIS WORKS AWESOME. Anything to do about the Multi Disc CDs not having an image?

Review 5: It seems the latest update does not authenticate correctly with basic auth anymore. I am using an nginx reverse proxy in front of libresonic. Testing connection in the app gives """"""""""""""""Connection failure. Resource not found. Please check the server address."""""""""""""""" My nginx log shows a 401 for the GET request to /libresonic/rest/ping.view. If I disable basic auth  the test is successful and the app works. Edit: I was able to get the previous version from the developer's GitHub right away  which still worked  and the developer sent me an updated version very quickly. The update was included in the next Play Store release  and everything is 100% again. Great developer and amazing app!""""

Review 6: Chromecast support makes this a no-brainer Updated review a few years on : I've had this app through three different phones now  a Samsung Europa  a Huawei G300 and now a Moto G  and this wonderful tool has never missed a beat. It remains the best streaming app ever  meaning my CD collection now resides on my home server  and I am literally carrying every piece of music I own a few clicks away. I bought the chromecast in the UK today on debut and my love for this app has just quadrupled ! The casting support on this app is flawless  and has just rendered a piece of hardware junk (WDTV Live) obsolete. Responsive developer who continues to push the envelope

Review 7: Best subsonic app available! Dsub has all the features you didn't even know you were missing from the official subsonic app. Playing and managing podcasts  managing playlists  and casting directly to my server are some examples. Last FM top tracks  similar artists  and artist radio are also nice in helping me rediscover my library. The developer is also very responsive and always improving the app. Speaking of which  artist radio stopped working for me after last update. Using Android 7. Please fix and thanks for creating a great app.

Review 8: Could be improved I like the idea. It would be better if I could admin user privs. Also  I need to view my music in list view  preferably with small text so that I can see much more of my explicit  long file names. I would also like the Back Button to take me back to Home if that is where I came from  instead of offering to exit the app... An Other Users tab would be cool. Streaming is smooth and awesome! More stable than the official client by far. Theming is a plus! I am happy with my purchase. Keep up the great work!

Review 9: Fantastic app that is consistently updated that I have used forever with Subsonic. A recent bug I have discovered relates to Chromecast usage and switching back to normal (local/online) use. After stopping Chromecasting  the app will sometimes give a """"failed to load"""" error when playing content normally until I force stop the app. I have duplicated this issue on 3 different devices (Nexus5  S7  OnePlus3T). Keep up the great work! Edit: disabling DLNA resolved the issue. May want to disable by default. Thanks again!

Review 10: This is great... I am able to stream my videos again. I noticed some new streaming features were added in settings. I was able to revert back to a transcoding mode and I can stream my videos again. FFMPEG revisits the beginning portions of a video stream after it is done with a transcoding  but when downloading via the cache function this is not possible as the file is on the remote end  as a result my downloaded videos are not seekable  which is a drag. Looking to see if there is any workaround to this.",6985,The app is easy to use and reliable. The only gripe is the lack of support for multiple tags in the same field. The app continues to improve.

Review 2: My perfect cup! This app is perfect because it is a timer that allows you to create a list of your own presets.

Review 3: Pleasantly better than expected I make a cup of tea everyday and this app is perfect for it. Its super lightweight and loads up quick. When the timer finishes  it gives two short vibrations and turns my phone's indicator light on to red (the default timer app shouts at you till you attend to it). And the last thing I love is that it warns me when my phone is set to silent before I start each timer. Honestly didn't know I could like such a simple app so much.

Review 4: No use as a tea timer - doesn't remember the last time set... No use as a tea timer - doesn't remember the last time set. When you have added your boiling water  you just want to hit one big GO button  and have the alarm go off n minutes later  without faffing around with presetting the time and pressing Pause beforehand. Perfectly good countdown timer though.

Review 5: not just for tea! When I took OChem  I tried several timer apps during lab experiments. This one was the simplest to set and use. Since it only chimes once I didn't have to worry about rushing to the phone to turn off the alarm. The pleasant tone was a nice change from the jarring alarm-type sounds other timers had.

Review 6: This application could not deserve other than five stars. It is better build than many other stop watch applications. In fact  I now use it to many other things than tea and in this case  I'm really happy to be able to change the picture to the green circle. Thanks!!

Review 6: It's awesome!!! This is like slack and signal but you can host it yourself. Federation works well. Documentation is really good for being in such early stages. This is the future. Make it happen! Download and run with it ;) But remember it's an early adopter thing. Check out the fosdem 2017 talks about it and read the medium posts

Review 7: After a quick test I'm pretty sure this will be my main messenger some day. It also has all the features to compete with the big names. Most importantly it's federated through Matrix. Many of the features are non existent or poorly supported in xmpp clients. When End To End encryption is enabled by default it'll get my 5th star.

App works great  I get notifications everywhere without wasting data like IRC. Perfect replacement for IRC  as it is wasy to use and does not leave a connection open the whole time.

in.blogspot.anselmbros.torchie,Negative,"Review 1: Works  but activates volume controls every time Pressing the volume buttons together on my gs6 running 5.1.1 does work to turn the torch on  but every single time it also adjusts the volume levels. Also have to use both hands to get both volume buttons at the same time. Truly more complicated than pulling the phone out from my pocket  screen on  swipe down  enable the built in flashlight toggle. All one handed. This actually complicates the process significantly.

Review 2: App not working while it's not running App is working fine while it's running but when you close it its not working... When I press vol buttons while it's running in lock screen it turns on torch but when it's not running nothing happens... Why is that so and how to solve it? And yes I've accepted all permissions but when I close the app it seems that it forgot them. I'm on android 6.0 on my Redmi Note 4 MIUI 8. Ty.

Review 3: Makes my phone hiss Great app! Very convenient! My only concern is that my phone hisses when the screen is off. I've done some extensive testing make SURE it was THIS app that was causing it. Sadly the more I tested  the surer I became that it was IN FACT this app causing the hissing. I've uninstalled the app but would probably reinstall if this bug was fixed. (Nexus 6)

Review 4: Not working on moto g Doesn't work with the screen off on my motog phone. I need to have the app opened and lock screen off again to make it works. No sense cuz unlock the phone  open the app  lock it again and push the buttons makes me do more steps than unlock and slidedown the bar to press the flashlight icon. Nice idea but bad implemented. Sorry for my english

Review 5: It makes my phone hiss I had to uninstall it because while being installed and working on my device  my phone is hissing when the screen is locked. Additionally  I like that it works by pressing button with screen off but it's inconvenient to press two volume buttons at the same time.why dont you implement double click on one of buttons?

Review 6: Eh. Not good LG PHONES Its quick to turn on but not practical on LG. Phones like the Stylo 2 plus or any other phone that has the buttons in the back of the phone which are programed to be your instant photo buttons. Tried to use it but it was hit and miss. It would take pictures and seldom turn on the flash light. Sorry.

Review 7: does not do as stated  does not work at all. can not turn torch on via buttoms all settings are enable and still doesnt work huawei y560 android 5.1 dev doesnt listen all settings are active and notifications access granted and services active toggle active still doesnt work on my Y560 or icon nero

Review 8: Good idea! But it just doesn't work no matter if all settings are enabled. I enabled 'Torchie Functionality'. Pressing and holding volume buttons does nothing when screen off (enabled). On lock screen or unlocked. I really like the idea. Maybe I'm doing something wrong? Samsung Galaxy Note 3

Review 9: LOL What a crap .. doesn't work on lock screen..i tried all the settings .. and just wondering how hard it is to hold both the volume buttons to turn it on and off silly crap .. the power button everytime accidentally clicks .. hopeless waste and even not working hahaaa ..

Review 10: Risky For such a simple sounding app i dont understand why you need access to what i type  personally i dont think that has anything to do with just pushing 2 buttons together to turn on a flashlight  do away with that and i might consider it but until then its to risky",3539,The app works by pressing button with screen off but it's inconvenient to press two volume buttons at the same time.

The app is free with no ads or limitations suckering people to donate  meaning that it is at our leisure and I love how this developer gets it. Second: No ROOT!!!! Love it. Third: I love the simplicity of the app and the ability to choose between flash and screen. In my case  I went with screen because my phone has no flash. I just wish when i turn the torch off  the screen would turn off as well. Or when i press the power button the torch would turn off

Review 2: Good app! Update! 15/02/16 1) Version 1.2.0 of torchie with the screen off timer function isn't working on my Note 4  it doesn't switch off the flash at all  2) While in the screen off timer mode the volume switch function should overide the timer function but doesn't either. Thanks for the functions Dev  hope you can sort it out asap  Good app that's easy to use  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""can I suggest on the screen off option that you impliment a timer that users can set to turn off flash after a set time?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Review 3: Crazy awesome! Everything works as stated  wet it needs is a different way to activate the flashlight make triple press or press and press and hold  it doesn't work the same way when the screen is off though. When you enable it on screen off and it doesn't activate on pressing he two volume keys at the same time try volume key down then up. I don't why it works that way on my Samsung Galaxy Grand Neos. Otherwise thank you waiting for that update and keep up he good work.

Review 4: Much more convenient than having to go threw settings to turn a flashlight on when you need it. Also the proximity feature is ingenious overall satisfactory app! Only thing I would add to improve this app would be like a """"""""""""""""ultra bright"""""""""""""""" feature  thus allowing users the option to switch on and off a brighter light than the stock flashlight-torch (obviously with a notice stating: can cause battery drain faster in ultra bright mode""""""""""""""""""""

Review 5: On while light is on  with disabled """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""screen off"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode Works great. One thing that can be added is when you are not having """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""screen off"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode on  that you can still shut off the light when the screen went off. Some hybrid mode. That would be useful if you need the light for 20 seconds  but the screen turns off at 15 seconds. Something I experience many times :)""""

Review 6: Awesome This app is exactly what I was looking for. A way to turn to use the phone as a flashlight in the fewest steps possible. No digging the phone out  unlocking  and clicking the icon. Just  by touch mind you  grab phone and press both volume buttons. Bam. Flashlight on. And either press them again. Or wait for the configurable time out. To summarize  no ads  just convince. TLDR: best flashlight app ever.

Review 7: Good but Doesnt work with my screen off on my s7 edge. The light blinks on for a second and disappears. I need to go to the lockscreen for it to full work. All my settings arr correct though and the app works great otherwise. Very convenient. (changed from 4 to 5 stars because developer replied ☺️ appreciate the response even though no solution provided haha)

Review 8: Brilliant Simplicity - Simply Brilliant What more can I say. This free app does exactly what it says on the box. It turns your mobile into a more useful torch by giving you a physical on/off switch that works even when the phone is locked and the screen is off. Thanks for simplifying something that should be simple. Brilliant!

Review 9: -1 Star It works on the lock screen and when the screen is on. It's more convenient than using a notification to control the flashlight. -1 Star because on Galaxy S7 the light can't be activated when the screen is off  even after turning on the appropriate setting in the app; instead  the light just flashes for a second.

Review 10: Works but not really I can turn the flashlight on and off with my with my my volume buttons but it will for sure mess up my volume settings. I would give this app 5 stars if you could make it so a long volume up hold and a long volume down hold makes the flashlight work.",4213,The app is free with no ads or limitations suckering people to donate.

Review 3: Has Potential  but currently is broken I hope this app is improved. As for now it's broken. It won't accept correct password for photos. It worked when I first installed it though  which is baffling. Right now I'm too afraid to use it. I would not store important information if I have a random chance of not getting it back.

Overall  I definitely think I would recommend it to anyone looking to take some of the strain off their eyes at night  from the overwhelming brightness of your screen(s).

Review 5: Small  Simple  and Good Looking Finally a tool that's useful and doesn't want to mine the data off your phone like all the others do with so many permissions. All it asks is to 'Overlay' a dark tint on the screen which is the whole app itself. Perfect! Well done Developer.

Review 6: One of the best Screen Dimming apps 👏 Great Design. Smooth Flow. Very easy to use. Notification priority management could be useful as notification stays on the lock screen. And my Moto X 2014 screen could get a little bit more dimmer. Anyway  great app and awesome design.

Review 7: Great. Easy to use. Very simple and clean app works great. Best part is  it doesn't overlay the notification bar (unless you want it to) so in the morning it's easy to turn back off. Only problem is the app crashes if you move the selector too far to the left (bellow 25%)

If anyone else is having problems  try this! Original review: This app does not seem to save the converted file. I tried twice to convert a pdf on my external SD card  but the file does not appear in the target directory.

Review 2: Can't convert. It weird when im using google play book it work perfectly to view my pdf. Im using this but it totally worse

Review 3: Single to use  didn't work for me Very easy to use interface but it unfortunately did not work for my project. Moving on.

Review 4: Output is GIMP Technically functions  but the epub files are buggy  and crashes most reader apps that I have. Shame

Review 5: Nonsense and useless app! This is useless converter that mess up all of the character and page of PDF file.

it.iiizio.epubator,Positive,"Review 1: Absolutely yes! Reading Pdfs on smartphones is a kind of self-torture : if you zoom in  you get horizontal scroll. This little thing delivers the cure: it makes with few clicks 100% responsive epub. Usually one doesnt need such tool - books are managed on desktop with calibre or the like. But if en route  just now downloaded something and dont want to break eyes - this app is the tool to help out. Disclaimer: dont tested it with image based pdfs.

Review 2: Very Good. Works perfectly except for placement/scaling of technical books  which often have many big reference pictures in the middle of text. I am not entirely clear on whether I need to keep my phone awake while this app is processing a conversion but it would be nice to have the options to keep the screen awake or produce a custom alert on completion. Is batch conversion supported? Definitely the best option I have found.

Review 3: Light and Simple OK Just converted a couple of books  one had 461 pages  and both were easily readable. This is a beautiful small app for quick conversions on your phone. And it's free! Conversions had errors but these were cosmetic. (If you want your final epub to look different  open it in an epub reader like Moon that allows you to apply a template to the epub file.) Thank you Mr. Developer.

Review 4: Best OFFLINE pdf to epub converter around. In fact  it's the ONLY offline pdf to epub converter around. Pity it does not deliver the same results I would achieve with Calibre on a pc  but it is still better than wasting precious data to convert ebooks online (why would one want to do that anyway?) and download them back to one's phone or tablet.

Review 5: It changed the pdf document into continuous lines of text with no spaces between the words. Hi  Ive changed my rating: the developer advised I try different pdf's and now I have found one that works  although the lines of text are too long. I'll experiment and review again later! It does work!

Review 6: Works quickly  and was accurate up to a point. I actually didn't notice any problems until several pages in. For some reason  while coverting an all-text PDF  it would break at the end of a certain paragraph  skip a page and a half or so  and pick up again at the beginning of another page.

Review 7: ePUBator Works very well for me. Changes PDF files so I can read on kindle  nook  apps. In PDF form the pages run off the page before you need to turn the page  with ePUBator it repairs the problem very fast. Use it and see for yourself

Review 8: Helpful Thanks for a reliable product. Still very reliable. If you have problems getting a pdf converted with this product sometimes shortening or changing the file name helps. Always works for me.

Review 9: Converted my PDF to nothing but 1200 blank pages. Edit: Tried other apps and they didn't work either  so I assume it was the file and not the app. Also  VERY fast response on the issue  thank you!

jackpal.androidterm,Positive,"Review 1: Was: incredibly powerful! Now: missing features I have used this app for many years. I noticed a while ago that the control modifier (volume down) no longer worked. I tried making it volume up but that didn't work either. Sad because I really like this app but it's worthless if I can't send ctrl-c commands. I uninstalled Terminal Emulator and tried Termux. Termux seems to work better and the modifier keys all work.

Review 2: Simple and functional with just the options you need for it to be useful for what it does. This  of course  is for people who know what a command line is and know that Android is Linux  and know how to use the Linux command line. But  if you do  it works great. I couldn't find cut & paste though. So that needs to be made more visible if it's a feature.

Review 3: It's... okay Its a great tool and all but you will have to be familiar with both the Windows CLI and the Linux Shell. Even with that it doesnt have all the commands you want and directorys/files arnt color coded. Im certified network and OS specialist if u needed to know if this was valided from a source with experiance.

Review 4: This is an excellent terminal environment for Android/Linux users who need to tinker around on their devices in ways not otherwise afforded by stock apps and settings. I've used it for as long as I've used Android devices and have never had a single complaint. Would be nice to see its creator release more software!

Review 5: Good Couple of things I'd like to see. Better support for the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""top"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" command  so that it will accept keys entered. Also easier shortcuts  like the ones where you can tap and add ctrl key amd then hit the letter you need  for example. See Juice SSH.""""

Review 2: Great app...but... Why are there no data source options built in? When I try to add new ones it lists three apps in the Play Store completely unrelated to Just Player. I had to go and find and manually download the .apk for ampache support. What is up with that?

Review 3: As others have reported  it doesn't work with Ampach properly. It connects  without error. I see it fetch ajax.server.php and xml.server.php from ampache's access.log file but nothing else happens. It doesn't load up any data into the player. Nothing

Review 4: Abandoned Says updated biweekly but hasn't received update since March 2015. Plays music but lacking in basic features such as lockscreen controls. Widget does not update as track changes.

Review 5: Doesn't work After adding ampache server  you go to view ampache in the menu under cloud -> ampache. It waits for a second then redirects to the main screen. No error  just does not work.

Review 6: Best player so far and does videos However it keeps crashing my Bluetooth service on android N whenever I'm pausing my music  which caused my earbuds to reconnect and start playing again

jp.co.kayo.android.localplayer,Positive,"Review 1: Exactly what I was looking for Really like this music player and the smooth UI. Widget is nice and clean and loving that the player supports album art which you can easily download from the web through the player itself. No lagging between songs either which amazed me when streaming over slow mobile data :) Unfortunately when streaming music from Dropbox  if the player hasn't cached the song and you try to add album art or modify the title in the library  it crashes :( Prolly need to stream all songs first and then start modifying those little details in the library.. Otherwise a really good app  smooth and clean. Hoping development continues to make this the next big music player ;)

Review 2: LOVE Great GREAT app! This has such potential to be the BEST music app - mp3/4 editor  player  and manager. Easy tag editing  easy multiple song selection to create playlists  and auto- generated playlists based on your song ratings! Choose the number and types of view tabs too edit/play from (folder  artist  song  etc.)  and even more  you can select the viewing style (album icons  list  artist tree  etc. Couple things - have had problems with crashing  and the web album/artist info search doesn't work (?).

Review 3: Works but ui could be improved I'm using this app to listen to music stored on my ampache server. The problem is that browsing and searching is not that easy. Could you add a search (in artists song name album etc) at the same time? And a tabbed layout for switching between artist / songs /.. Would be cool and not by picking it from the list.. If you do this 5* for me. Currently I feel a bit handicapped. Would support you btw if you update it :)

Review 4: Worked great until new phone As stated it worked flawlessly with my S2. I just upgraded to a S5  and while it will play music  it does not start the next song after the one I selected finished. It goes to the next track then pauses. I have to hit play for every song. I don't know how to correct this issue. If I can't get it sorted I will uninstall  which will be a shame since this is the next best thing since Audiogalaxy was shuttered.

Review 5: The only good Ampache client Tried the others on the play store without success but just player just works. There is a strange icon in the album art screen that looks like a world map  which crashes just player on every tap. Overall it is a great app and also looks nice. For those not able to connect  make sure you have stream access and RPC setup in your ampache admin settings before using just player.

Review 6: Been using the app for my ampache home server. The latest release did wonders  however there remain a few glitches here and there. Overall I really appreciate the developers! I have been having an issue with Bluetooth while using Just Player. My Bluetooth Service fails  when connected occasionally  while browsing the menus while playing. Samsung Galaxy S5.

Review 7: Almost perfect Latest update and ampache is all fixed. Album art is showing and songs that have never actually started playing now work. Brought the specials as a thanks. Easy play all album would be nice. Mono sound option would be handy to others like me who are deaf in one ear.

Review 8: It worked! I have tried many different clients and ampache configurations  and I finally found one that works! For now I am only able to stream music from my admin account in ampache  but after spending many hours on this I am quite happy with the result!

Review 9: Very nice but still needs work No back path from playlist. Needs a way to go back to files so you can select more items to put in playlist. Also needs default sort settings. Love the new interface looks great and works sharp.

While the readings seem to mirror the cpu process load  I have no idea how accurate it is. I would love to see an update to this app cause it really is well done otherwise.

Review 9: Just about perfect! I have it started automatically at boot time  via another app (autorun). The beauty of seeing an icon in the status bar (and the notifications list) is that you can track your battery usage in real-time and kill (or uninstall) processes before they drain your battery.

Review 10: Everything is fine  great app. But when not all cores are activated  the icon changes to an ugglier one. It's better it keep being the same and just shows the cores working (quad core -> always 4 even if sometimes not all of them are working ...)",3584,The app tracks your battery usage in real-time and kills processes before they drain your battery.

jp.yhonda,Negative,"Review 1: This is a useless POS. The program might work  I'll never know because the documentation is appalling. If you already know the function names you can use the example function to discover the syntax. And if you don't  you can't. You can spend an hour or two trying to guess how to plot the graph of y=x^2 between -1 and +1 and get absolutely nowhere. Nothing in the manual gives you a clue. Like most free downloads  it's written by  and for  enthusiasts who are functionally illiterate in English and incapable of explaining anything.

Review 2: I *really* want this app and I know I'll really like it! (I use it on my laptop now.) But it simply won't install. I have a new ASUS tablet running 7.0 Android. I download Maxima  but when I try to install it and select internal or external memory (doesn't matter which)  I get the message that it didn't install and I should remove it and try again. After doing that several times  I'm pretty certain this app simply won't work. Don't know why not  but I'm *VERY* disappointed.

Review 3: Doesn't seem to work on Nexus 9 (7.0) I like maxima. I use it with my students in class and thought it might be fun to have it on my tablet. It installs and runs the help screen but can't perform even the simplest calculation 1+1. The program hangs. Sorry. This must be an amazing effort.

Review 2: Best CAS for Android! Started using this after Octave port became nagware. It takes a while to get used to but is breeze once you get to know the commands and syntax. The manual is very helpful and have quite a few examples for almost all the commands. Since the outputs are rendered using MathJax  you can export the output to LaTeX. This makes it great companion for compiling TeX documents on the go. Kudos to the developer for bringing Maxima to Android and keeping the spirit of open source! Much appreciated.

Some dongles from china draw too much for the device alone to power. Working great again! Thank you.

This morning  I reflashed the magisk v6 zip file in TRWP  rebooted back to Recovery and flashed the phh-supersuer-17-magisk.zip file and then rebooted and it was back to normal. Note that the root checker sees root  but not the binaries but root is working just fine.""""

Review 2: Great with Magisk As a long-time SuperSU user  I've been quite pleased with my transition to using this version of Superuser. Bundled with Magisk it has been a perfect option for root access to my device without compromising some of the built in features of the latest and greatest Android versions. I'd highly recommend giving this a try if you're looking into Magisk at all... even if you aren't looking at Magisk!

Review 3: Great workaround for root goodness I did notice that root was lost after I rebooted my phone (for another reason)  but after a little tinkering around I found if you go into phone settings then developers options and change the root setting from whatever it's on to a different setting then root is restored ..BTW I'm on galaxy note 2 running cm13 rom ......G2KEA ..pika pika.

Review 4: It does the job and more.. Works great with Magisk  can support tap to pay compared to SuperSU and others. Works great  never had a problem with root and root apps so far... Those people asking the Binaries must not have flashed the Zip file via recovery

Review 5: Amazing - after chainfire decided to transfer ownership to a relatively unknown company I decided to give this app a try and this works surprisingly well. A small improvement - the su request should be a pop up rather than a full screen prompt.

Review 6: Open Source Options! So glad to have a good open source option for root on Android again. Good on the developer for caring  I hope there is a way I can donate to further development.

Review 7: Works well! After Chainfire sold SuperSU out to a shadowy shell company I ran into this. With the proper zip flashed this works with every su-requesting app I've tried with it.

Review 8: Almost there. Still fiddly when handling root requests from certain apps  ie. V4A  AdAway  etc but all in all amazing root manager app. Feels more lightweight than Chainfire's.

Review 9: 🤘 Certain root apps previously not working with systemless root are good to go  AP accepting transactions; real forward thinking collaboration with Magisk. Thanks  y'all

Review 10: Works great I used supersu in the past and had no complaints but switched to phh after flashing magisk. Works great so far with no problems on my galaxy j510",2908,"Me.phh.superuser is an open source root manager app. It works with Magisk, SuperSU, V4A, AdAway and other apps.

me.sheimi.sgit,Negative,"Review 1: Could be more user-friendly It's a good working app  but I miss some fearures: There should be a way to let the user decide to which directory a repository should be cloned (and maybe a button to open that folder). I also miss a feature to copy the URL of an existing repository and to backup/restore it's settings. And my last suggestion: Add a log screen  because error messages (toasts) like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""pull failed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" are not helpful  the user likes to know WHY.""""

Review 2: Welcome Back (under new management)! NEW: Most issues fixed. I will test it out and update my review later. OLD: I have the same complaints as everyone else: why can't I specify my own local directory  etc. But  as it hasn't been updated in at least a year and a half  I'll have to wave off potential buyers - look elsewhere. I cannot recommend this app until some of the complaints are addressed.

Review 3: But could be better I would use this instead of pocket git if I could chose the local path of each repository and use the external sd. Edit: I still can't use the external sd because the file explorer doesn't have .. (go dir up) and also can't write the full path directly. Why doesn't it let me just write the path?

Review 4: Decent client  could be better I'm mildly disappointed that it doesn't seem to support two-factor authentication  and every time I go to add a repo over ssh it's kind of a guessing game to remember the correct format for the repo location. Other than that it works well.

Review 5: Why can't you choose where you want to pull a repository ? Also keeps crashing on Nexus 5 - 6.0.1 Edit: Thank for the update  just checked the new version. The local path is just a text field  why not use a pick folder dialog?

Review 2: SGit is a stable  feature rich Open Source Git client. I would have preferred ASL v2 rather than GPLv3 license. Together with LugaLabs Source Code viewer and K9 Mail  this makes for a fantastic trio ! Thanks Rizhen Zhang for sharing this software with the community.

Review 3: Great app. Earlier I complained about lack of edit capability. Turns out that authors do document local repo path in notes  and the message I was getting was from the system not from sgit. So  this has everything I need  great app  i recommend it

Review 4: Working on 6 again. I do have one feature request now  import an existing repo already on the storage. Great support when it finally came :) edit: it does indeed  can you tell the difference when importing as external repo?

Review 5: Thanks for making it possible to push hotfixes while on the go :-) Managing a repo and editing code on a phone is never going to be a pleasurable experience  but this app (coupled with VimTouch) is as good as it gets!

Review 6: Needs to be more flexible This is a solid app and with the option to specify the top level folder in the latest version  it provides the perfect complement to programming apps that are not git-aware.

Review 7: This app really did the good job. Unfortunedly it doesn't support ART in Kitkat.. Please dev  We can't hardly wait to see the updates for kitkat users with ART... I just edited my stars..

Review 8: Very good app Works very well and is very intuitive. Could not push to repo when 2FA is enabled in my account  tho. App does not understand SSH either.

Review 9: Glad to see it back This is definitely the best git client for Android. The new developers seem intent to keep it updated and supported.

me.tsukanov.counter,Positive,"Review 1: Simple Counter is exactly what it says in the title  a simple tally counter app. The feature to count is there with buttons to add or remove from the counter. There are more features though  with the ability to store multiple counters  edit the number in the counter  value reset  and volume buttons to use for counting. As a free and open source app  Simple Counter does what it does well with very straightforward and direct tools for tally counting with a simple yet useful mindset.

Review 2: Simple but needs ability to swipe between lists Heavily relies on a hamburger menu & needs ability to swipe between counters. Other improvements could include negative counting  grouping of counters  counter interactions (e.g.  2 counters can be linked & a rule set so that when the first counter reaches 10  the second counter increments by 1). Otherwise  this is a good simple material design app with multiple counters & even a dark mode!

Review 3: Brilliant app! Material UI - the best for Android apps. Works very well  no issue. Ability to block screensaver is awesome. Might recommend to have an option to reset without warning  as well as ability to enter the number to increase/decrease by (on button long press and/or on specific counter properties - the step).

Review 4: Simple! You press a button and it counts. Mistakes are correctable. Values can be manually overwritten. The volume buttons can be used as shortcuts. With no ads and free use as icing on the cake  this is a quality app that does only exactly what you need it to do  reliably and easily.

Review 5: Great for Shiny hunting in Pokemon! This app lets you make multiple counters that you can bounce back and forth between so it is perfect for tracking all the different shinies that I hunt for in increments! It works like a charm and the feedback options are awesone!

Review 6: Love physical feedback! Not only the button is physical (+/- button)  but here are neat feedbacks w/ short vibration to ensure the confident feeling that your device actually counted each one push on the button. You cannot count with mistake with this solid one.

Review 7: Simple and nice Best app to count. UI looks clean and interactive. One input I wanna give is the sound option for the button click is not working properly. That's not a major issue but I wanted you to notice it. Great job. Keep doing simple apps like this.

Review 8: Copy button for perfection Just add a little copy button at the top pls then it will be perfect. And if you can give the option of dividing the + & - buttons left-right respectively with the - button smaller  so theres no more need to look while clicking

Review 9: USEFUL FOR SOFT RESETTING SHINY POKEMON It helped me a ton on counting how many soft resets I did on trying to make a shiny Cresselia appear  I even love it cause it saves the number of counts even when the app is killed/force stop  thanks alot!

Review 10: Wonderful App For Shiny Hunting! The app is simple to use  and for people who shiny hunt or anything of that sort  it's perfect. You can easily track the SR's you've completed.

Review 3: Good work! Nice looking  simple and efficient markdown note-taking app. A great companion for Synthing to manage my notes on my phone and my tablet. Suggestions: one smaller option for the font and a searching by name option that can look for files into the folders.

Review 4: Open source  nice! there are a few bugs here and there  and a few missing features I'd appreciate (easier image and other tag insertion  some checkbox simulation  folder coloring  github flavor)  but overall a decent markdown editor

Review 5: :) Perfect replacement for my default note app. Easy to use. Could you add undo function and also a way to move files up and down (when you have many files in a folder)?

mobi.omegacentauri.SendReduced,Positive,"Review 1: at least the option isn't there. does have option for normal SMS  which for some reason doesn't work. it does work with whatsapp and line. oh...and I second the opinion on the bad icon design: use solids for such a small icon  simplify too  and use an eye catching color different from the most common communication programs installed so us users can easily pick it out of the dozen or so applications. Update 2016 After using it for a while  found it does work with hangout  however due to the limitations of sms  only one image at a time. It does work well with all other apps. Great handy utility!

Review 2: Highly recommended It is a highly useful utility and does what it claims.

mohammad.adib.roundr,Negative,"Review 1: [SOLVED] Broken root call for hiding the icon. Broken request for the root function to hide the status bar icon. It's annoying as hell and if I have the root I can obviously see the logs.Seems like Roundr has a broken call function for the root on SuperSU. Fix it and this small app will be great.

No touch controls recognized. Only solution - long press Power button  and cold reboot. Second; in developer contact I am taken to xda entry which is a long page singing the praise of the developer  or download.. No entry to log bug reports  or contacting developer.

Review 3: Moto x kit Kat bug There's an option to hide the rounded corners on the kit Kat home screen because of the transparent notifications bar and the transparent bottom home/back/multitask bar. This option does not work in moto x running kit Kat. This is stopping me from buying the pro since the home really looks messed up because of that. Otherwise everything else is perfect and gives a brilliant aesthetic appeal otherwise. Cheers!

Review 4: disabling roundr on kitkat home hi  i have been using this app since past 6 months without any issues. but recently when i updated to kitkat the home screen wasn't looking pretty. how do we disable the roundr for kitkat home screen   keeping it enabled else where. ps: i tried the settings there was an option  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""disable on kitkat home screen""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  it didn't do anything""""

Review 5: Still doesn't work with kitkat Not entirely the app's fault but it just plain ugly on kitkat. transparent nav bar and notification bar mess the transition to home screen up big time. it is also not always persistent so you'll see a lot of sharp corners transforming to rounded all the time

Review 6: Useless and ugly The desing is very  very bad. This is because the corners round at the edges  but the status bar isn't rounded. This makes it look awefull in apps that support the statusbar color (e.g. google play  samsung print services  etc...). I would advise against downloading it!

Review 7: 25MB of Memory and. 32% cpu used to run this????? I have great and fast phone but 25MB of memory and up to .32% cpu usage seems excessively high for such a simple app. Uninstalling this its not worth the memory or cpu resources to have round edges..... Buh bye

Review 8: Doesn't work anymore.. I recently updated my phone to KK v4.4.4 and also changed my old Launcher to Nova Prime. Unfortunately Roundr stopped working. With Nova Prime I can't get rounded corners anymore no matter the settings I try.. sad..

Review 9: Good job but a few glitches This app is perfect but it messes with the overlay function. So it doesn't allow permissions necessary for other apps. It gives this error 'Overlay detected' Otherwise its a decent app if this issue is fixed.

mohammad.adib.roundr,Positive,"Review 1: Great app... with a couple of issues Great app  though there are some things that I wish were different. I wish it worked in the Google Launcher on KitKat and Lollipop. I wish it worked consistently on Lollipop (the rounded corners come and go seemingly randomly). I realize that it can't be applied to the status bar  but if it at least worked on the bottom corners I think the GEL would look better. Also if the rounding could be applied to popup boxes  such as the app drawer  that would be a great enhancement. Overall 4/5 stars!

Review 2: Great application  but the navigation bar? I really appreciate that someone finally mad an app like this. It's a great app  but on my Nexus 6Pit doesn't round the corners on the navigation bar and rounds the corners of the domain above it. So I hope the developer can implement that. And best possible case  choose for each app what corners should be rounded and over the status bar  navigation  bar  just the screen  or in any combination of those options. And another thing is if the icon and app can be updated to material theme.

Review 3: ABANDONED?.. This is a truly great app that seems has been abandoned by the developer as for a very long time already it has not been updated. I've used it for a long time  and has always been one of my favorite Android apps.. but now with newer versions of Android OS  new launchers and a growing number of newer apps  unfortunately I start having several compatibility issues.

Review 6: Beautifully made app Love the app   however it could be better if the nav bar could also incorporate the curve designs   in some UI the nav bar would change colours and if the black borders are there it gives a curvy edged screen feel to it ? the transition of the black piece into the screen is not great thou ? I wish it would be like corner slowly wrapping in and form a round edge instead of a pre-cut black piece PNG sliding upwards

Review 8: Works as dilescribed  ALSO TO NOTE: This small yet BIG design changing app  has created a NEW phenomenon within the cellphone market (here's looking at you Samsung S8 and LG G6) looks like if this 'fad' catches one day ALL phones will come with rounded corners! [ Also a side note: I owned the first ever Android phone and it came with Rounded coners... interesting almost 10 years it catches on ]

Review 9: Better than expected It does what it's supposed to  and although it's not a drastic change  I've found it hard not to use it on all of my devices. Really improves the aesthetics without getting in the way  and it doesn't apply the effect to the nav and notification bars or on your home screen. Doesn't look as good if you match your notification color to your applications though.

Review 10: Very good The app works very well and it gives my phone a fancy looking round screen. However  when I set the corners not to overlap the status bar  it looks kinda weird when the status bar doesn't have a solid black color  sometimes it imitates the main color of some apps (like red on YouTube or green on LINE).

naman14.timber,Positive,"Review 1: Some little bugs and design issues  great otherwise! After installing it  a now playing bar shows up at the bottom and  when touched  shows the now playing page  but blank. Also  in the now playing page  there's no difference between the repeat all and the repeat song icon. And in the first now playing layout and main screen  that animated equalizer icon gives me a feeling like the app lags  because of its low framerate. Besides that  it's an awesome app  you can even choose between multiple now playing layouts!

Review 2: Good start. Improvements primary necessity not aesthetics. Great looking app. A little too good for its own good perhaps. 1. Struggles with animations( option to turn them off available but still no one likes to turn animation off that too when it looks so beautiful). 2. Lacks equiliser  but still a problem that can be overcome easily. 3. Couldn't find a widget which was surprising. There's a lot of scope for this app to be a great hit! Can check our Rocketplayer and blackplayer for further improvements! Atb.

Please rectify these mistakes! - *I am not able to delete any song ... * I am not able to make a new playlists and add new songs to new playlists!(please add these features!!!) * there are few bugs like - the song title is different from the song which is being played ... (This happens sometimes) *I am not able to open equilizer settings... Whenever I select the option ...nothing happens.... * auto playlists work slowly! Please make these following changes

Review 4: Good start  but needs improvement When the main FAB elevates in the now playing screen the shadow is clipped (like numbers in the same screen with the fourth theme). The status bar becomes way too dark in the album tracklist  and it would be nice to have a choice for color combinations in the app  along with the possibility to have the FAB following the color of the album cover in the now playing screen. The hamburger menu icon is also too small. Overall it's a good start.

Review 5: Still a beta and quite buggy  but beautiful. I really like Timber. It's beautiful  customisable  uses both dark and light status bar icons if your ROM supports it (Xiaomi & Huawei/Honor users (on EMUI 4) will be happy!) It's still quite buggy which reminds you it's still in a beta state. As an example when you skip a track it might still display the previous song's info  the headphones' button does not work with it... But it's still a nice player.

Review 6: Very bare bone While Timber has a nice material design and functions fine  that's about where the compliments end with the application. There are no notable feature that distinguish Timber from any other music app  lacking music ratings  FLAC support  a decent onboard EQ (uses regular system EQ)  or even Chromecast support. You're better off with the more popular options.

Review 7: On LG G Stylos (Timber *BETA*) So far starting out nicely. But dont screw it up and only offer the good options on a paid for version. My biggest issues with music players are Meta Data availability. Must have option to manually AND automatically DL artist images  album art  lyrics...etc. Black Music Player my fav right now...follow their lead.

Review 8: Great potential but bad performance I installed this to compare with my default music player on a Samsung Galaxy S4  and I liked it for the most part. The visuals and customization are fantastic  but it is sadly is very poorly optimized and inefficient. If they could just manage to make it run better I would rate 5 stars.

Review 9: Love the design but needs an update Extremely pleasing to eyes and the functionality and design options r way too good.. But please improve the performance..

name.boyle.chris.sgtpuzzles,Negative,"Review 1: Recent issues A weird glitch keeps happening. Every so often  colors will invert  so everything is white on black. Typically happens if I click in an odd place (like just now it happened when playing Bridges and I tapped just on the edge of a circle  cuz my fingers are clumsy)  but other times it just happens randomly. It's a very hard glitch to replicate and I can't willingly switch it back  but it's been persisting for weeks now.

Review 2: Good but snags After several games it introduces no wins and the touch pad betrays moves to errant moves. Using the Solve feature works well on simple puzzles  but on complex ones becomes confused making box canyon moves from which it cannot remedy. A good game but uninstalled due to the errant moves and no win scenarios -- too much like real life to enjoy the no escape aspect.

Review 3: Lights up logic now avoids offensive shape Really!? Is nothing ever allowed to be random now  for fear of offending someone? Social justice warrior much. For the record  I'm deeply offended by the word 'puzzle'. It goes against my religion  and I look forward to the next update where this app is renamed to not use that deeply despicable word.

Review 4: This Simon douche has the worst tathams  what ever the heck that is  ever! All these puzzles are ripoffs and horribly adapted counterfeits of the nice originals. There aren't even mentions for these! I would give this abomination a 0 out of 5 if I could!!!

Review 5: looks like something developed ten years ago or older not even for Android talking about mouse etc.  not really proper touch screen controls  i am not rating game because i was not able to figure out how to control it even with reading help

Review 6: Love it  bad update The game no longer has the option for sound when you do a long press. Can't tell if i made a selection. Have to keep trying. Very annoying.

Review 7: One suggestion I would like more options for controls. My fat fingers have lost too many games that would have otherwise been personal best times.

Review 8: Awesome  but... I tried 300x300 with 30000 mines but it crashed and wouldn't reopen  reinstalling now  please fix so I can play more minesweeper!

Review 9: No explanation. I wish it would tell you how to play. I understand how to play the games but not sure how to make moves such as code breaker.

name.boyle.chris.sgtpuzzles,Positive,"Review 1: An extremely well-thought-out app. Includes a built-in comprehensive help document for rules  instructions  and controls. Includes arrow controls for certain games where precision may be difficult on small screens. The seed and puzzle sharing utility is a welcome addition. Looks professional enough  though material design would admittedly be nice. This one free app is like several apps in one  in a package so well-presented that it's worth money  but is instead free as in gratis and free as in beer. A must-have.

Review 2: best puzzles app no ads  no suspicious permissions  lightweight  and incredibly extensive. the minesweeper generation fix preventing you from losing on the first click or from ever having no other option but to guess are a really neat touch. sole issue is that generating a Loopy puzzle too large begins to squish the graphics and make numbers hard to read as they are partially obscured by the lines  whose thickness doesn't seem to scale as you zoom in  but this isn't a serious problem

Review 3: Stellar app The customizability  ease of use  lack of ads  multitude of games  and randomly generated puzzles makes this the best app  by far  for any puzzler. My only complaint is that within Black Box  there is no option to automatically fire the laser beams after generating a puzzle. But even this is very minor and only begins to show itself in the larger grids. 10/10 overall and in almost every category. Thanks for this amazing app  and I look forward to the future of it!

Review 4: Review updated June 2016: now 39 games AND pinch-to-zoom! This is the one game app I put on every single device I own. Awesome app. These puzzles are loads of fun - like the author put it  they work great as little """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""toys"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to help pass the time. Having them on my phone is even better! Touch interface works really well  although larger puzzles are easier to control with a tablet even though there's pinch zoom. Definitely recommended.""""

Review 5: I don't normally do ratings... But when I do.. it's a game that I spent time playing and I still want more. Has no ads and is enjoyable and challenging. Doesn't make you feel like you have to play it all the time but it comes on your mind when you have some downtime - I could solve a puzzle or two! Definitely recommended. I'd say one of the few must have games for your android that you'll keep for a looong time because it just never gets old

Review 6: Nothing comes close for this genre in apps  PC games  magazines  or books. Actually MORE than 39 different puzzle types  as many have multiple variations and difficulty levels. Nothing to buy  no ads  and an infinite supply of puzzles. Wishlist: Nurikabe  Battleship  Easy as ABC  Kakuro. Get this app and """"""""""""""""100 Logic Games"""""""""""""""" and you're set.

Review 7: So much Many apps would have only one of these puzzles and would go popular. This app has so many different game modes that are all customizable. It is easy to understand and it has puzzles for everyone. You can start with easy ones and get better on them. And if you get tired of one kind of puzzle  just pock a new one and you will get sucked into it. This is my favorite app that I have on my phone and many more people should have it.

Review 8: Simply the best game for mobile! It has some problems with the user interface here and there  but after you get used to them  this is a great game. And it is free! And I don't mean that garbage that is wrongly labeled as free  and that is instead bloated with advertisements. If you are into puzzle games you will love this. It is also multiplatform  so  you might also play it from any pc directly in your browser visiting their website!

Review 9: Puzzle Lover's Wet Dream This app has a large variety of puzzle games for you to test and play  from classics like Sudoku and Minesweeper  to things I'd never seen before  like Undead and Net  all in a small  well optimized package. You may not like every game  but you will likely enjoy enough of the games to make this worth downloading and saving for those moments where you have 5 minutes to spare and want to exercise your brain.

Review 10: No frills  just good. I have my favourites that I keep going back to again and again. There are lots of puzzles for every ability  and no ads anywhere! It really is a bare-bones proposition. The help is a text file  and there are no hints. If you're stuck  you can always jump to the solution. That's not a hint  but it can help you determine techniques.

net.androgames.level,Negative,"Review 1: Not bad but could be better No bugs  just missing an important feature. Pressing calibrate just zeros the level - poor! It should take a measurement  tell you to rotate 180 take another  then zero using the difference. If your phone is in a case it's the only way to get it right (same way levels have always been calibrated). I've never seen a phone with buttons on the back  and if you're using it on it's side you're not turning it over you're rotating it - calibration would compensate for the buttons. Stop making excuses and fix it.

Review 2: Level Wow! I give it one of my ULTRA  EXTREMELY RARE 5 STARS .... 4 is my top rating UNLESS the app is ETHICALLY responsible ...THIS APP DOES NOT ACCESS ONE SINGLE INFORMATION IDENTIFIER!! WHICH  LET'S FACE IT  STEALING YOUR IDENTITIFIERS AND USING THAT INFO FOR ITS OWN MARKETING OR PERSONAL AGENDA  (AND/OR SELLING IT TO THE LARGEST GLOBAL SPY GROUP ON THE ENTIRE FREAKING PLANET ...US' NSA!) IS THE SOLE REASON MOST THESE APPS are even in existence!! I bet they think  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""haha!! SUCKERS!!""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Review 3: Now sux This app has sadly outdated itself  I know this is a hobby app not professionally designed but if you want users to support your app you should fix the accelerometer settings in your code to give the correct readings and maybe turn the ui into an over polished turd with other handy tools built in also so it's more appealing to a wider audience  a general multi purpose tool  not whatever the hell this is  ads or pay and support me eh hmmm seems as though I'm caught between the devil and the deep blue sea!

Review 4: Bad user interface Hi there  I tried to use your app on an S6 when I really need an app like this for a small home project but yours was hardly usable due to colors. You shoud make that buble white  or other color  so it should be contrasted with that blunt gray backgound. Because the buble has no evident color I eas strugling to see how acurate is its position. One star  because I couldn't use your app when I need it for the purpose it was built.

Review 5: I have used this app for several years without complaint. Latest update  however  included ads in notification bar. I have no issue with free apps displaying advertisements while being used  but annoying and intrusive advertising in the notification bar (especially while the app is not running) is cause for removal of the app. Which is a shame  because this is otherwise a handy app to have.

Review 6: B.R.H. I read about this app on a app review site  and the review was glowing. I went to the play store and read the reviews  they were all 4 & 5 stars. All I can say is why it doesn't do anything much. It does say  in app purchases  so I suppose one has to pay in order to get all the functions. The free version is nothing short of useless  I've uninstalled it  it's a waste of battery.

Review 7: It works fine as long as you stop to recalibrate every time you want to check something. This gets irritating about the tenth time you have to do that. My version is totally up to date  went out of calibration by 15 or 20 degrees since yesterday!! In addition they put offensive ads on the screen. I am uninstalling this because it's almost useless.

Review 8: Unable to understand new version readings. New version doesn't let me know whether surface is inclined or declined but it just show just a bubble and when my phone is on a plane surface bubbles doesn't let me know anything about surface. It givea readings like its an inclined surface with many degree angle.

Review 9: Handy tool. Idk how many times I run down to my garage to get my level and run back upstairs. Then when I'm done it'll sit out for a week before I put it away...then once I do that I need it shortly after. Now I just use my phone and its very arcuate!! Don't know what took me so long to get the app!!

Review 10: Wtf I thought this was a joke. It actually wotks. I'm sitting here on the toilet taking a dump and testing if the sink in this bathroom is level. It's slightly off but very close to being level. Great job on this app. Now I need to find a toilet paper app. Im out of paper and I can't get up!",4178,Reviews of the 'net.androgames.level' app have been mostly negative.

net.androgames.level,Positive,"Review 1: I wish all apps could be as well written as this one! No Ads  no permissions  hardly takes up any resources  extremely accurate  retains its calibration well  HUGE display that's well designed and clear and easy to see  it even autorotates to display the correct level depending on orientation of the screen. Tried some other similar apps and their dismal performance made me think my Nexus5X might just have very poor sensors. Nope - they were just hopeless apps and it took this one to prove it! I set up a level surface using a digital level and my traditional spirit levels until I was sure it was just right  and then used that surface to calibrate Bubble Level app. That was weeks ago and it's still spot on. Now recommending it to everyone I know.

Review 2: Best Level out of the three I recently downloaded! I would have given it five stars  I am unsure whether the gyroscope in my HTC One m8 or the app is to blame for my slight """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""problem"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". When I calibrated on a flat surface and then tried to use it to level a shelf it would show an almost even surface but the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bubble"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" would stick in place if I didn't move the phone for a couple seconds. In the end it's still a great level app as even though the bubble animation would stick I could still use the numbers underneath to find levelness! :)""""

Review 3: I figured out a way to calibrate it! Take a piece of foam larger than your phone/tablet. (I used 1"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Styrofoam insulation) Float the foam in a bowl or your sink full of water. Place your phone on top of the foam and wait until it stops moving.......press calibrate. It should be fairly accurate at that point. I have a Samsung S2x with a battery that bulges out at the back and it was the only way I could figure out how to get level with it. Simple but useful app. Thanks. Edit- Decided to buy the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Pro Version"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Worth the $2 (Canadian :-) )""""

Review 4: One of the best. One minor thing keeping it from being perfect. After trying all of the bubble level apps that don't require permissions this was one of the best. No ads  no permissions  incredibly small footprint  responsive and easy to read display  able to separately calibrate each side...The only problem is that it's too easy to hit the calibrate button. All it takes is a quick tap and whatever side you were working on will be off until you can find a perfectly level surface again. Hold for 3 seconds to calibrate would be better. Still better than anything else tho

Review 5: Most Excellent App Used this to level my ex-girlfriends washing machine. At one point I thought the bearings were away as the washing machine was jumping about the place and sounded like it was going to blow up! Checked level with this app  and adjusted feet on washing machine. Probably saved a few hundred pounds. If I hadn't used this app I can guarantee the washing machine would be ruined by now. Has to be the best app I have ever downloaded from the app store. Seriously  you can not beat this. And best of all it's free!!!

Review 6: Bubble Level This app is great! Since I like to think of myself as a guy on the up & up  the bubble level helps me keep my cool during tough decisions. Last week I used it to help me make a level headed decision to go ahead a rip that fart in a crowded elevator and blame it on the retarded kid with the helmet on. I was unsure what to do but this app helped straighten out the situation! Able to calmly walk out the elevator without an angry mob chasing me as is what usually happens. All thanks to the level app!

Review 7: No permissions!!! This is a sweet app  I don't need it but found it useful when setting up digital scale level or hanging the occasional picture. Just keep in mind when calibrating that most smartphones aren't made with flat edges and make proper adjustments. In example; case-back of Galaxy S has a ~wave~  device therefore cannot sit flush. Sides have buttons for power and volume but mic edge is straight. With that in mind use leading edges w/o buttons and you'll get more accurate readings. Looks cool too.

Review 8: Like it but While I understand the creator's point re calibration being done by the side  rather than the traditional method for digital levels of first calibrating facing one way  then the other  and automatically averaging  as far as I can understand it the current by-the-side method would only work if you had... a level. Gee. So right now I'm going to go to the basement and try to calibrate it with a level  and hope that it maintains its calibration over time. Other than that I think it's marvelous!

Review 9: Light and Good app It is the lightest bubble level app that works well. its calibration data does not have a reset key  however by holding the calibration key it can be reset. If it shows inclinations 0 & 10 as lines in both sides of tubular level and a circle in spirit level  it will be more useful. Also in the spirit level its better to show the value of maximum inclination and its direction. The maximum inclination is square root of sum of squares of inclinations in x and y directions.

Review 10: I have found that the level accuracy varies from phone model to phone model. Generally higher quality or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""more expesive"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" phones are much more accurate and reliable. My friends Samsung note 5 was significantly more sensative and accurate over my htc desire 510. Other then that it is an excellent software.

net.bible.android.activity,Positive,"Review 1: Compared with the Sword Project app on iOS (PocketSword)  I was very pleased to discover that this """"And Bible"""" app also supports: * multiple synchronized windows * verse comparisons for multiple translations * off-line text-to-speech audio. Some enhancements found in the iOS PocketSword app that I would also like to see here: 1. Display commentary for an entire chapter (just like an entire Bible chapter is displayed)  and not just commentary for one verse. 2. Immediately display the footnote info when I tap on the highlighted footnote letter (just like a Strong's number definition is immediately displayed) instead of requiring me to first select the verse and then choose from the context menu """"Footnotes and references"""". 3. Show results from my previous 'find' so that I can easily visit each search result and not have to repeat the search. 4. Add the ability to download new modules from user-defined locations. I already have many text & commentary modules shared from a non-public server  and it was awkward to have to manually copy them onto the Android device. But even without these requested enhancements  I'm happy to have a Sword Project compatible app on Android!

Review 2: I love this app and  for the most part  can't imagine another that would enable users simpler access to the key features this app offers. Any attempt to make it more sophisticated would DISTRACT (from the main goals for using such a program) and would DETRACT (from its powerful and yet wonderfully simple-to-use functions). Worth mentioning  however  is that  after the program having worked perfectly on my former Galaxy S5 with Lollipop (Android 5)  I switched to an Alcatel Icon 4 with Marshmallow (Android 6) and found that  every time I tried to start using the app  I would respond """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Yes"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to the initial dialogue pop-up asking if I wanted to Download a bible version  yet the program kept then showing an error msg like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""...cannot connect to the Internet.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Review 4: Good resource  non intuitive interface I'm grateful for this wonderful Bible resource and have used it for several years. However it's utility is hampered by awkward and non-intuitive interface. The developers would do well to carefully study Google's interface standards and change the app to conform more with the familiar Android interface conventions that most Android apps conform to. What is particularly odd is the whole mechanism for the selected resource Bible commentary dictionary. Even though I've used it for years I still haven't figured it out

Review 5: Go to Bible app on every device This is a great  light weight app. Bibles & materials must be downloaded in app but a huge public domain collection is available. The most resources are in English but Bibles are offered in an amazing amount of languages. Backed up bookmarks  etc. need a file explorer to handle if you are transferring across devices. (use some automated setup to sync by home or cloud then manually restore backup & you'll keep reading & notes in sync across devices) Menu is a little confusing & odd but works well. TTS  more.

Review 6: This was my favourite Bible for everyday use. I still miss some features found in My Sword  but it looks better  it reads easier and My Sword does not have voice. I got Ivona Voice working again. Please give an option to pause voice  maybe even fwd & rwd  if at all possible. Together with Ivona Voice  this was wonderful. I miss being able to highlight and make propper notes like in My Sword. Giving a little star at a verse is not enough. You have Afrikaans available without conversions like in My Sword - thanks.

All that would cost hundreds of dollars for hard copy books and be in the form of big bulky books but now it is on my phone for free. Thank you for a great app.

I'm running Marshmallow  so it may work on older versions of android.

Review 3: Works great. The only issue which is not really a problem with the application but a limitation of Android is that volume increases in big steps  instead of gradually. To work around this  if you're phone is rooted  install xposed module VolumeSteps+ and set volume for music to 50.

Review 4: I cant live without this app I listen to music and podcasts everyday while driving and this app saves me from constantly adjusting my volume while traveling at different speeds. With a little tweaking  the app is nearly flawless!

Review 5: Brilliant app  works perfectly for me on Bluetooth. It takes some tweaking of the upper and lower speeds and volumes  but I'm glad the options are there for fine-tuning.

Review 6: Excellent After the Mar 6  2016 update (allowing us to pick specific Bluetooth devices for activation) this app has become truly useful. It works exactly as expected.

Review 7: Very Useful With Tasker 5 stars for adding a Tasker plugin. I use it when I turn on my driving mode profile.

net.cyclestreets,Negative,"Review 1: When trying the Android app (with offline map pack for the UK) today when using the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature I encountered two bugs which make using the app an incredibly frustrating experience: * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode the app does not keep the screen awake so after the phones """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""period of inactivity"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is reached the screen is switched off. This is incredibly frustrating as I had my phone in a case and I had to take it out of the case to switch the screen back on. * When in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" mode and using the offline maps if you switch out of the app (i.e. using the task switch button in Android) and back into the app the maps completely disappear  the route is still visible (i.e. the lines) but everything else is gone. The only way I've found to fix this is to stop """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and start it all over again! I found this issue due to the previously mentioned issue where the screen would turn off. When I switched the screen back on and went back into the app the maps were gone. I would appreciate if the developer(s) of the app could fix this as the bugs mentioned above make navigation using """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" a real painful experience.""""

Review 2: CycleStreets is a journey planner for bicycles - with options between from Quietest to Fastest. It was better in the past - when set to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Balanced"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it used to avoid busy roads  and LiveRide used to give verbal instructions. Now it favours Terrible Trunk roads  Awful A roads (e.g. A15  A287)  and Busy B roads (e.g. B3400)  and Rowdy Roundabouts (especially if they join busy roads). I don't find these routes particularly enjoyable. I think the problem is that it considers a 50 mph (reduced visibility) B road to be quieter than a National Speed Limit quiet country road. Finally  LiveRide is completely silent. I tend to use Locus Pro now  as it can speak to me.""""

Review 3: Stressfully Slow Even with offline pack it takes minutes to load. As the pack includes none of the details of OCM it's of limited use anyway. You cannot manipulate the route planner to go a certain way that you prefer  which is essential since no mapping app can ever be perfect. You can go between 2 saved locations or select points on map but not mix the two  which is annoying when most new journeys start or end at saved spots. Route planner has max 10 waypoints which is no good for London's round-the-houses infrastructure.

Review 4: To many bugs please fix New version work very bad  I am very disappointed. It do not show my position any longer  only on navigate mode  witch it become impossible to navigate the map. The minus a plus bottom are so much need  as an other user say  with gloves it was super hendy. The quiet road calcolation is not always a goog road for bike  maybe a hike or some mtb total off-road path. Please fix bugs..you are my ever best app  I been use it for the start and used for very long distance too..

Review 5: Mostly unusable Conceptually this is a great app. I have found some interesting and useful routes from it and there is nothing else available that does the same job. However I have now given up using it mainly because the mapping is completely unreadable on any current smart phone. The resolution is incompatible and does not scale. It is also pitifully slow to load regardless of bandwidth  exactly like the sustrans website. Geat shame.

Review 6: Poor  maybe even dangerous. I've tried to persevere with this app. I checked my usual commute via local cycle path network  and I was unable to understand the description  even though the route was the one I ride. Describes curves as turns  doesn't know where the mini roundabouts are  or where the barriers are  just flummoxed  if live this to be great  but it is simply useless. Not to be trusted I'd say  you were warned!

Review 7: Map won't show! Just installed it and map worked at first but now every time I open it the screen just fills up with loads of images of the app icon and completely obscures the map. Have had to revert to Google maps which keeps trying to kill me on main roads in central London. HELP! I am a newbie rider with no road sense. I need quiet routes.... Eff off google!!!!

Review 8: Absolute mess completely unusable  can't find fleet street in London (!)  then it can  then it can't  then it can... For some reason I can only search for street- no house number  after flipping phone app resets to beggining greeting. Very frustrating. Maps are great on website but it's a bit tricky to carry Pc with me while biking.

Review 9: Not working anymore with OnePlus Suddenly stopped working  crashes and is not even able to send a crash report. V.disappointing as no way to see whether it's an app update or system update at fault. Liked it quite well before that. Have to use the web version now  which ia very annoying. Really hope the developers look into this!!!

Review 10: I like this app....but Whilst navigating  the map vanishes and I'm left with a squiggly line...

net.cyclestreets,Positive,"Review 1: I found this useful.. I do a lot of cycle touring and I have found this app incredibly useful as an alternative to carrying a stack of OS maps or a to z's. Using the downloadable maps is great for reference as i don't need any signal. The one thing I feel would be an absolute godsend would be if the sustrans routes were marked on the downloadable maps  or if a version of the open cycle map were downloadable (even if it needs updating from time to time). I'm not a fan of the route input method  so I tend to use other apps for tha

Review 2: Best routes I'm giving this 5 because the routes are consistently ones I love. My ride this morning ride from Tooting to the Thames Barrier was fantastic - quiet easy streets. The UI has improved no end too and LiveRide is working again! The only slightly clunky thing now is that when you choose 'current location' as the starting point it starts you from the last place you centred yourself on the map - even hours ago. But still 5 points from me - I just have to remember to centre myself before planning a route.

Review 3: Great service. Fixed bug quickly 2016: once bug was reported  developer fixed bug quickly. 2 Star Review May 2016: Can't get voice navigation to come up on my Nexus 6P  so almost useless now (I've made comment on Github). Quiet routes much safer than Google Maps. I've figured out how to show rental bike places. 5 Star Review 2015: Strap phone to my arm and it talks me through the quiet back streets of London. Wish there was better integration with rental bike places showing empty slots near destination.

Review 4: Much better I used to get very frustrated as cycle streets wouldn't re-route. I used it today and it was loads better : re-routing just like it should. It took me a great route out of the worst of the traffic but still direct. Now it just needs to let me know the name of the street I'm turning down a second or two earlier and it will be perfect. I use it with one earphone in following verbal directions as I reckon this is safest  wouldn't fancy cycling while trying to follow route on the screen.

Review 5: Best cycling route planner Gives far better cycling routes at different levels of traffic and desired cycling velocities than Google maps. Plus it's great to plan a route when you have a signal (or via their website and enter the route number) and with downloaded offline maps you can navigate without a signal. All for free! I don't use the LiveRide feature (ehich needs some work) I just look at the map on my handlebars. It imports GPX so you can customise routes in another application.

Review 6: Superb You need the huge offline map pack also  or a good data budget. Get handlebar mount on Amazon. Phone with front facing speakers on full. Another app to leave screen on. I get about 3hrs cycling before battery dies. It navigates me from central London to green belt flawlessly  and the girl speaks quite posh  which is a bonus and startles chavvy passers-by :) Incredibly good free app  mind bending. Please stop those carping  reviews guys  or do some free coding!

Review 7: Great if you stay on the route Really enjoyed using this app. It got me successfully from beckenham to Waterloo today with accurate turn by turn navigation in my earphones. however if I went more than 50m off the route it said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""recalculating the route"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but then failed to give further directions until I went into the app which meant stopping and getting the phone out.

Review 8: Used this app for the first time today. I reached my destination but only after having to double back on myself a few times due to the voice navigation being slow at telling when I needed to turn - this was even after changing the settings to be notified 150m before a turn  hopefully this will be sorted in later versions. I will definitely try it again though and hopefully be able to add another star or 2 :)

Review 9: Finds the route I want but... This is a great app for routing but only when it works. Its very tempremental and crashes continually on certain areas of map. I havent even bothered to try the live ride feature. I just couldnt trust the app not to stop working halfway. A real shame because this has really good potential. I'd also like to be able to export my routes to other software... ?? Maybe one day ??

Review 10: Cycle streets Really good app for cycle friendly streets  and I like that on live ride it tells you to get ready to turn  my only wish was that at the get ready stage  I wish it told you the upcoming road name as most of the time it doesn't tell you until you're actually turning and if you aren't looking at screen (phone in pocket) it's too late! If that could get updated it would be perfect.",4780,Netcyclestreets is a free cycling route planner app for the Nexus 6P.

I have tried updating. But no luck. I am using Oneplus One with KitKat.

This problem still exists in 1.5 - Flym has two articles from today for the BBC  RSSDemon has 80. Ditto for 1.9. If this was fixed it would be the best reader out there

Review 4: GREAT READER! I like the full text extraction and the ability to split my sources into multiple folders.

Review 3: Good  but missing 2 factor authentication This would be a great solution if I could store the actual key on the tag  not the path to it. That would be a real 2 factor authentication. Cheers

net.minetest.minetest,Negative,"Review 1: Good  but not up to snuff I've played this game quite a bit on the PC  and love the heck out of it as a free alternative to Minecraft. However  this mobile port leaves a lot to be desired. My main beef is with the controls  which makes it nearly impossible to build or craft anything substantial. It also has less-than-stellar support for the mods and games that make the PC version worth playing  and adding any mods at all tends to trigger a lot of frame drops. Bottom line: this is a good game on PC  but the mobile version has far too many problems.

Review 2: Nothing like Minecraft. So many people will download this thinking that it is a Minecraft clone  but it is nothing like that. The crafting takes some getting used to  but the pause screen (accessed by the 'back button) tells you everything you could possibly want to know. The only problems are that the settings are not pointed to at the beginning with some kind of notification. P.S. this version has multiplayer support with the computer version.

Review 3: This is more or less just a direct port from PC to Android that has been done very badly for example  most text and buttons don't scale very well  the servers require an account but it doesn't say where you can create one  and don't get me started on touch sensitivity that's off the walls to high even at 10! I'm not trying to be rude or anything but i think this app needs to be fixed or redone.

Review 4: To all the individuals who think this is bad because i [insert minecraft related thing here]  consider that this game is for people who cant afford minecraft and this atleast has MODS  PLUS people just prefer the game. If you dont wanna give constructive critique to this then just buzz off.

Review 5: I would have rated it lower I literally couldn't do anything  its like they didn't finish making it  every time I tried to connect to a server it would say connection lost or something. And it was super laggy... I COULD FREAKING HIT A TREE FROM A MILE AWAY! And that was weird...

Review 6: Unplayable for me Tapped the button to increase the UI size multiple times when I first played. The taps took like 10 seconds to register. Of course I tapped too many times. Now the UI is fucked up and unusable. I did try to clear data/cache/reinstall but nothing changed.

Review 7: Completely red world ripoff no mods verison of Minecraft. Litterly have to download another app for mods. No basic fly button  junkyiest inventory screen ever  crafting = Horrible  ripped off Minecraft  and has some lame ore called Mesa  also same dam seed over and over.

Review 8: REALLY!!!! WHAT THE HECK IDK WHAT HAPPENED BUT IN MY GALLERY I HAD 47 FOLDERS WHICH I ONLY HAD 12 BEFORE AND ALL EXTRA FOLDERS HAD AT LEAST THREE PICTURES THAT SAID MINETEST. SO NOW I HAVE TO DELETE ABOUT 500 PHOTOS. EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED!!!!!!!!

net.minetest.minetest,Positive,"Review 1: I've decided to look for an alternative to Minecraft ever since some...monetization decisions regarding handling of user-created content. I think I've found what I've been looking for which is this game. What I love about this game is the customizability this offers in terms of modding. I had lots of fun trying to pick out mods to install in this game to tweak this game to my liking and I guess this is the charm of Minetest. My only minor gripe for this game so far is the d-pad being kinda small  and there needs to be an option to resize it.

Review 2: **NOT A MINECRAFT CLONE!!! This game is an amazing example of how far an open source community can go. Minecraft is an absolutely amazing game and if you want it so bad  then buy it! Minetest isnt some half effort clone waiting to cash in on minecrafts success. Minetest is a product of community effort and virtually no funding so give this game time to mature and develop and fix bugs! Minetest is for fans or people who want a break from minecraft not for hardcore minecrafters. I hope you guys give this amazing game a chance!

Review 3: A nice FOSS version of Minecraft I actually just heard about Minetest when flipping through a free and open source repository. That said  I am impressed with how many features Minetest has. It plays a lot like Minecraft to the graphics and gameplay  but it does offer extra modding features to extend things even more. Shoutout to the contributors to the Minetest project for making a cool open source version of Minecraft  and to more interesting things down the road.

Review 4: Good The controls are odd  but at least I get to use the few mods I have made on the go. Note to the 12 year olds who keep complaining: The difference between this and mine craft is that this is easier to make mods for  and this game is free and open source  meaning you can look at  modify  and redistribute it freely. I was made with those features in mind  NOT being a 100 percent minecraft clone. That's why it has different crafting recipes.

Review 5: Minetest is one of my favourite open source games  and with good reason. It's free  it has built-in modding capabilities  and creating servers won't put you to sleep. But this is probably why I prefer it over regular Minecraft: IT'S THE SAME AS THE PC VERSION. Like  the exact same. Almost no functionality was removed. But they should add more save slots in this version. Also add save slots.

Review 6: Minetest expert here!!!! So I've played mintest for about 3 years almost a lot and it is almost beating minecraft yeah sure the graphics is not at its best but its quick and aficiant and are very harsh on adding a mod to the game itself I would rate it 1 000 000 if I could and thqs to Venessa  and all the others for bringing us this game I'm very glad u did ;))

Review 7: Great game. I'm much better now at navigating. The problem is managing inventory and crafting. I can't select just one item from a stack because I don't know how to mimic a right mouse click. Tap-hold with a second tap drops half the stack  so I have to go through that process to get single items for crafting. Online or in-game help for this platfom is lacking.

Review 8: The only limit is your imagination when it comes to minetest! I love the game  I love the engine I love making mods  I never get tired of it and if I do I can just make something New to add into it. The only problem is many other apks of minetest use the full desktop version of the main menu and I like to have multiple world's and be able to use texture packs.

Review 9: I've literally played minetest for about since it came out and I know some people rated this 1 but notice the minetest android version is still in development. This game is awesome. I've even met DanTDM (I'm not going to say in what server) but I've even talked with people and made some good friends like asia14 AndrewBoss DanTDM xanadu and many more

net.momodalo.app.vimtouch,Negative,"Review 1: Is a pity this app is neglected (no blame for dev  whose situation & priorties I can't know) but FCs and stability issues now mar a brilliant concept. Vim is actually a great fit for Android: complete navigation and selection control by word/line/block with just the standard keyboard (no wasted screenspace) & split (particularly diffsplit) are killer features that no other editors come close to. Being able to open additional files without exiting app or fiddling w/ menus is also a big plus (hadn't realized how much using slide out menus or the recent apps menu disrupted my process until now). FCs and associated risk of data loss relegate this to being essentially a demo. Still can't bring myself to uninstall though because I WANT it to work so badly. There are a few other issues: word-based input waits for autocorrect to finish before vim gets any input - so many commands are unworkable & you must watch keyboard's prediction row to see what you've typed. Editing .vimrc and other setup involving home directory was also a bit fiddly (though  if I could figure it out it can't be that bad). Overall Vim on Android is hard to argue with  hopefully updates remedy the outstanding issues.

Review 2: Needs Work!! Since I use gVim every day at work and home  I was glad to see this for Android  so I installed it. Then my phone kept rebooting. I'm an IT Architect  so I knew what to do. It took me a while -- a couple of weeks  of uninstalling a couple of other apps along with this one (the apps I had installed just before the phone started rebooting)  then re-installing them (over days!) and then uninstalling  and so on. As I say  that took many days  since I would have to wait for a couple of days to see if the phone would reboot or not .I finally was able to conclusively prove that it was only after I installed Vim Touch that the phone kept rebooting. I have now had it uninstalled for a couple of weeks  I've reinstalled the other apps  and my phone is not rebooting. Since it does not run all the time in the background  all I can figure is that there is something that is going haywire during the install itself  causing problems later on. File corruption? Something not being registered right? I haven't done any Android development  just UNIX and Linux (since 1980!)  so I don't know what to tell you. Fix that issue and you've got 5 stars from me.

Review 3: Can't understand the 5 stars It doesn't seem able to manage its own internal files. Several times I had to go into /data deleting swapfiles of Vim Touch's config files. It doesn't seem to have any resilience to its own preference settings. Even if your phone is rooted  don't set Vim Touch's Root option! It will never start again so you can't switch the option off. Other pref settings and normal vim uses also do this. And oh wow: *don't* try using vim encryption. Hangs and force quits everywhere. Then it made 3 of my files become zero size. All my 40+ others apps are working fine. I can't understand the 5 stars for Vim Touch. Perhaps people are just enjoying it as a toy or a novelty. But if you try to do anything half-serious with it it will break and take some of your files with it. (HTC one rooted with very stable CM10 and no problems in other apps)

Review 4: some debilitating quirks Erratic keyboard behavior. Sometimes the keyboard goes straight to insert  othertimes it doesn't. It's hard to know because the *insert* notification is inconsistent. When it does start in insert mode and I escape out  it automatically moves the cursor back one character. Default tabbing and spacing on linebreak is nonsensical. Pasting from the external clipboard adds a double linebreak. The worst (dealbreaker)I have to constantly restart the app because I lose the ability to edit at random moments.

Review 5: Too unstable I love vim and I love the effort made to duplicate many of vim ' s features including folds and plugin support. But crashing when swiping to move about a file  is particularly annoying. I have tried creating lots of navigational shortcuts on the toolbar just so my fingers don't have to touch the screen text input area. Also keep as few as apps open as possible. Still crashes. I purchased another editor to get the stability needed when editing my python files.

Review 6: Appreciate the effort. I appreciate the effort the developers put into this  but the crashing makes it unusable. It crashed within 5 seconds of my first time opening this app. Thereafter  at random. I really want a stable VIM to use on my tablet  but without reliability  this is useless. I am going to dual boot Linux to allow me to use VIM  but I will keep an eye on this app in hopes that the quality improves.

Review 7: After last update  won't open Have been using this app for a long time. After the last update  the app will terminate immediately after being started. More in detail  the app manages to show the taskbar icon and the grey background of its main screen  then it suddenly terminates. It seems to generate no error however as it displays no error report screen.

Review 8: Finally root on x86 but FC (r1 too) Thanks for the update. Edit: FC after v2.7 update if root is enabled in preferences. v2.7r1 doesn't fix the FC. Worse  not only on x86 (4.3  SuperSU v2.46) but also on my older ARM device (4.1.2  SuperSU v2.02). So now I'm using older v2.6 on ARM with root  and this on x86 without root. Please do something :(

Review 9: Needs Work 1) Being that my device is rooted  I set in preferences for it to use root powers; but the moment I did this and granted root access to it  it wouldn't open  so I had to reset it  losing all my settings! Please fix! 2) Edit vimrc fails! It's looking where the file isn't stored and would be unwriteable there anyway! (in /data/.vimrc)

Review 10: Cannot go back in the directory Hell yeah it's a VIM! But unfortunately I was stuck at the directory when I'm browsing. I cannot seem to go back to the prev folder upon pressing the back button. I figured there is a dropdown list on the top action bar but when the path gets too long  I cannot see which directory am I at.",6130,Vim is actually a great fit for Android: complete navigation and selection control by word/line/block with just the standard keyboard.

Review 2: Vim Touch is an Android port of Vim  and it works very closely like Vim on desktop computers. There are some additional features and UI layouts that make using Vim on a mobile platform easier to use  with visual buttons and shortcuts to make editing on a touchscreen or small device more usable. Other than that  it's Vim all the way down with the typical features to expect from Vim being included here. Aside from some roughness caused by the UI suited for small devices and the Android system changing the behavior of Vim a bit  Vim Touch is an excellent port of the text editor for editing files with a familiar interface.

Review 3: Full Circle Though Vim (or vi) has been my favorite text editor for nearly 20 years  I completely get that biggest hurdle for most people is the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""mode oriented"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" editing environment. Ironically  it's this very modal nature that makes it so usable on a small form-factor device like a phone without having to sacrifice any of its editing power. (Of course  having a keyboard like the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hackers keyboard"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with real TAB  ESC  and arrow keys makes life much easier  but even that's not absolutely essential in this port.)""""

Review 4: Always solid Vim: love it or loathe it  it is what it is  and does what it does. This CAN be used to learn vim  but you had better make sure you have a keyboard with an escape key on it if you're on a smart phone  as it does get crowded. That said  if you're already decent with vim  this is a perfect companion for if inspiration hits someplace where you can't/won't have access to your full computer (minding  again  the Escape-key deficiency. I know there's a button on-screen for it  but it kind of breaks flow).

Review 5: Nice touch port but ... Vim was designed to be used with terminals and emulators. It's nice to see an Android experience of it' but really I was just looking for a vim bin that was compatible with the android environment. Basically  this is cute but there are 1000s of better editors for Android devices. I was just looking for one to use in terminal sessions. Not an independent emulation of the experience. I have no idea what use this would be for other than to say """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""neato"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".""""

Review 6: Excellent app - Vim on Android! The app crashes at times  but I can tolerate since this is Vim! If you are a Vim user  use this app and get the full runtime. If you are not a Vim user  even better to start using Vim. Vim is available for Windows  Mac  Linux  and Android - no more using several editors. Once you get used to using just the keyboard to edit files  your productivity will skyrocket! Vim is very powerful and underrated. There is not a better editor anywhere!

Review 7: I was skeptical at first  how well could via work on a mobile  but.... WOW! I'm amazed at how well this implementation is  it's entirely intuitive (as intuitive vim can be  that is  incredibly for those familiar  not at all for newbs)  and just plain awesome. I've always desired a more powerful text editor on Android  & it doesn't get more powerful than vim (no offense to emac-ers)! Now if only I could getting some actually getting work done on this darn thing!

Review 8: The BEST text editor on Android If you are looking for a free text editor on Android which could rival Notepad++ / gedit  look no further - this is it! Works well on my ASUS N7. Far better than the tons of adwares in this app store (by orders of magnitude). Pretty easy to use - with an external keyboard and VIM command cheatsheet. Only a handful of commands are needed to survive its command line interface :)

Review 9: Great app but... Is it possible to remove the title bar at the top with the vim icon  the pen and esc key so vimtouch is truly fullscreen? I am working on a limited eink screen size with a bluetooth keyboard and every available line counts for me. Does this option exIst? If so  I would be in heaven. Thanks for a great app

Review 10: Just started testing it So far it's amazing. It works. I find it challenging because I'm used to using my fingers and the keystrokes are all memorized.

net.nurik.roman.dashclock,Negative,"Review 1: I can't figure out how to get this to work properly on my Galaxy S7 running Marshmallow. The instructions (swipe to the left-most lock screen...) just aren't applicable; if I enable the lock screen and swipe  I get a keypad and a prompt to enter my pin. All I wanted was to see the time at night while my phone was charging. I used to have that functionality with DockClock Plus  but that app doesn't work under Marshmallow. If anyone can point me to instructions as to how to properly enable this app under Marshmallow  please respond. (Well... you can't really respond  but you could post a new review...) Addendum: If you send an email to the developer  you get an automated response directing you to a website that no longer exists. (404 error) Not a good sign.

Review 2: So far i was unable to configure it so it shows up on the lockscreen. As I understand this application wasn't created for lollipop but migrated to it. In lollipop the widgets on screenlock have been removed but this is what the app requires to be displayed there... If my findings are correct then either this app is wrongly flagged as compatible with my phone (LG G3 with Lollipop) or is so complicated to configure that it doesn't really worth the effort. Also tried """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""widget pager""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  another garbage application  for enabling widgets on locksreen.""""

Review 3: Does not work on lock screen with Android 5.0+ The description says this app is compatible with Android 4.2+. What they fail to mention is that lock screen widgets are no longer available in Android 5.0+ (Lollipop). I downloaded this specifically for lock screen notifications but that feature is no longer available with 5.0+ devices. You can however still add the widget to your home screen from the app drawer  just not the lock screen. I would raise my star rating if they figured out how to get the lock screen widget to work with the current releases of Android.

This app worked great until recent changes with Android and the developers haven't done an update since April  so they are way behind. Unfortunately  if developers do not change their apps with Android changes  the apps may not function properly  which is the case in review after review here and on forums online. No trying KK Widget to see if that performs better on Android 4.4.4 using the Aviate launcher!""""

Review 5: Not as good as mentioned I like this app for its clean and beautiful UI  but there are minor bugs here. One of them is  for example  when new messages arrived  it doesn't show the lock sreen with this widget  even though I've set it as default home lock screen before. I need to swipe to show it. How can I set it as default home lock screen? And also as other people told is there are no security and use at all. It may be used just for fun and wasting our time trying to use the apps. Developer need to fix this all...

Review 6: Nice app Don't listen to the people rating this 1 star  they are ungrateful idiots who should be mad at themselves for not realizing that their full screen lock pattern would not be compatible with a full screen touch-widget  or mad at Android for not allowing most 3rd party widgets on protected lockscreens with extra security in place. Guess what  its a nice widget that'll still work on ur home screen and its FREE so show some appreciation for the person who worked hard on making this yet didn't ask u for a dime.

Review 7: ?? LOVE but.. Unfortunately on the S4/Note etc  Samsung ?stupidly? decided that you can't have a secured lock screen while having your own personal widgets like this. So you either have an unsecured lock which allows for widgets  easy camera access  or a secured lock which only allows for their boring clock and stupid/useless personal message crap? Why? Google has already designed lock screen widgets to work perfectly with a secure lock Samsung. This is why people like your phones but not your software.

net.nurik.roman.dashclock,Positive,"Review 1: Looks beautiful and stylish  but... DashClock looks like a great and very useful app. Unfortunately  in spite of myself being a technogeek  installation is highly unintuitive and difficult  made even so when the different mobile device carriers are always changing the location of this command  that function. I would like to use this widget on my phone  but I will probably end up tossing it off my phone because it is too hard to set up (and I'm not one to give up that easy). I'd give it five stars but because of the installation issues  it deserves  at best  only two stars.

Review 2: It's not the clock that makes it great... UPDATE (12/7/2015) UPDATE 12/7/2015: Everything is working like it should again (it started working again once I updated to Android 6.0). Now that it's working again  I can fully recommend it to anyone and everyone. UPDATE: for the past few months the clock's extensions have stopped working. No idea what happened. Nothing updates anymore. Clearing cache and restarting the device didn't fix it. Neither does reinstalling the apps. Help? (Nexus 6 Android 5.1.1) Original: ...it's the extensions. Best clock widget around.

Review 3: Wow! Only noticed this cause it was in the Top New Free... best lockscreen ever! No funky lockscreen replacement  just a beautiful clock and notification lockscreen widget utilising inbuilt 4.2 features... Awesome! Edit: All these people complaining about being unable to use this with a locked phone are wrong - I used to have a pattern lock but had to switch to code due to policy changes but DashClock still worked fine with both. Yes  if you want to interact with any of the clock widgets  it will ask you to unlock the phone but that is expected.

Review 4: Great widget but one thing I can't figure out I love this widget. I use it on my home screen as well as my lock screen. By far my favorite clock widget. Only thing I can't figure out is when I have the home screen widget sized so that it shows notifications as icons with a number instead of the detailed view  how do you scroll when there are more than three apps with notifications? It shows 3 dots below the bottom icon but I can't find a way to see the additional notifications. I will change to 5 stars once this has been fixed/answered.

Review 5: Pretty nice. Missing so much though. Needs to show all notifications sent to the phone (using dash clock extension/s for the important ones atm but still) and a way to dismiss a notification from the lockscreen - maybe long press or double tap or two finger swipe. (normal swiping would be difficult with the already swiping nature of the android lockscreen) Option to light up the screen when a notification comes in. Really needs those features I think. For those with security problems  chill. It's an android limitation  not dev's fault.

Review 6: Had it for 6 months and still love it I got this after one of my usual app downloading sprees  downloading all the top rated apps for what I was looking for. After a lot of trials I came to Dashclock. I use it exclusively now. The widget is great with the available extensions. I liked how simplistic the customizing was and how elegant the screensaver mode scrolls whatever you want accessibly and subtly. It's not that flashy  but it's function is great as a home screen or launcher and I like it's straightforward style. 5*****

Review 7: It's awesome BUT... My battery level is sometimes like 10%behind the actual percentage  it refreshes when i refresh the weather manually which also doesn't always work  i must sometimes click the weather like a retard 1000 times so it refreshes and i have auto updates every hour.. Also I'd love to see more colors for the text  more customization generally f.e. What to display for every specific extension and stuff like that  more colors  change fonts  change density of the extensions.. Works on my HS flawlessly otherwise

Review 8: THIS WORKS WITH LOCK SCREEN! I have to write a positive review in defense of this app. If you are into customizing your phone this app will work perfectly even on a non rooted galaxy s4 or like phone. Using this app in conjunction with say widgetlocker allows you to get the benefits of dash clock while keeping your stock lock screen on. So stop saying this won't work with a lock screen... It will if you understand android and enjoy customizing your experience. This actually is a great app that works very well.

Review 9: Simply wonderful! I downloaded this recently to spruce up the home screen on my Nexus 4. At default  it looks identical to the stock clock widget on KitKat 4.4.4  but it has additional appearance settings  and also the much needed transparency setting which allow this to be better integrated with lighter coloured wallpapers. The extensions available are virtually unlimited. It's functional and looks great! An application  which in my opinion  is straight out of the top drawer! 5* ? thank you guys!

Review 10: I love this app! I have used this for a long time now  but one thing I wish they would add is the option to have either an outline or dropshadow on the characters in your dashclock  because I love the simple white clock widget look  but on some backgrounds it is unreadable  and I don't like the look of the black option  or the option that has a background on the widget! So please consider either a black outline option  or a bit of a dropshadow option. Thanks!",5432,DashClock looks like a great and very useful app. Installation is highly unintuitive and difficult  made even so when the different mobile device carriers are always changing the location of this command. Update 12/7/2015: Everything is working like it should again (it started working again once I updated to Android 6.0).
net.nurik.roman.muzei,Negative,"Review 1: Still the random wallpaper cropping ??? really ? EDIT: I don't get it. No one else is being annoyed by this random cropping of the wallpaper ? After so many updates  I still can't the crop and set the part of the wallpaper  which I WANT?

Will you pleas fix the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""bug"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which disables us to crop the whatever portion of the wallpaper WE WANT . Why is it so hard to do this ?? Every time I am setting a wallpaper  I am getting some random part of the picture cropped an set on my screen  WHY ?""""

Review 2: 5 stars when this frustrating issue is fixed After a certain update the pictures are not fitted to the screen correctly. I only see part of the picture. Usually it is cut off or just positioned bad. The annoying thing is it used to position pictures so you could see the whole thing where as the default way doesn't. so this used to be better then default  but not anymore. I have a moto g 1st gen. Someone else who rated the app also brought this up among other issues. Muzei answered for the other issues but not this one. Is it just me  or......?

Review 3: Very good app  specially with the NASA APOD plugin. The wallpapers are terrific  and I love the fact that the wallpaper stays blurred in the background until you double tap  at which points it comes into focus for a few seconds. Great touch  very slick. Highly recommended. *EDIT* I've noticed for several months now  the app has become buggy. Wallpaper doesn't update properly  the app crashes  and sometimes loads half a page... I stuck with it for months  hoping for improvement  but no luck. Sadly  I will no longer be using it. A shame  really.

Review 4: (for the Reddit plugin) So close... I was able to reproduce the multireddit I wanted to manually entering all 20 subreddits  which was a pain  but they stuck. After an hour  the wallpaper (which was set to cycle every 5 minutes) hadn't changed. I had to load the app twice before it pulled another one (edit: then 5 mins later it reverted to the first wallpaper). Double-tapping on the wallpaper is supposed to bring it into focus  but doesn't seem to do anything. Also swiping panes on my start screen doesn't pan the wallpaper like it should.

Review 6: Not working properly since update to 2.0 This beautiful application had been working perfectly for weeks until I updated to latest version 2.0 the other day. Now  tapping on image no longer focuses artwork. It just resides in the background  blurred. There does not appear to be any user setting to correct this and developer has not yet replied to my email about the issue. No option to uninstall update either. Was perfect until 2.0. Muzei Live Wallpaper for 4.1  a different app available on the Play store  worked. YMMV.

Review 7: One Gripe  Otherwise Perfect I recommend Muzei to all my friends  and use it on every Android device I own. There's one thing in this latest update that bugs me though - the alignment of artwork (at least using GPE launcher) is off  with artwork being cut off on either side. Before  the picture would align to the right absolutely  but now there's a buffer space no matter how many screens you have on your home screen. This is a bummer  since I use nowPaper for the Chicago artwork  and now the buildings are all cut off.

Review 8: Missing the Obvs - No More It seems odd the one would want quality Art Blurred in a background App. Why cant the picture be focused @ all times? Thanks Roman. Would it not be easier for the default to be focussed and peeps can then blur it if they want? Don't quite know why they would want to  but appreciate different strokes for different folks. Thanks again. P.s. could you make it storable on SD card rather than internal memory  as when peeps internal phones become full they may have to lose this App.

Review 9: I am so done with Muzei on Lollipop It basically crashes if you look at it the wrong way. Even with no extensions installed. And if it crashes  good look loading it up again because it will keep crashing until you reset all data from the system settings. That means have fun configuring the whole goddamn thing over and over again. - for the dev: I assume it has something to do with when the app can't load the correct wallpaper - it happened with when photos that I picked where deleted from storage.

Review 10: Not sure if this is an issue just for me  but I have this app on 2 devices and they both cycle through subreddits regularly about every 10 minutes while on WiFi. I've found that over time the app stats taking up quite a lot of storage and I had to go into the phone settings to clear the data from the app. The app got close to 800mb large. Not that big of a deal since it can be solved by clearing the data  still slightly annoying to need to do that every so often. Love the app otherwise!",5505,Muzei Live Wallpaper for 4.1.1 is available on the Play store.

net.nurik.roman.muzei,Positive,"Review 1: My favorite wallpaper for years. Friends and family are always asking what my wallpaper is  and I love the consistency between my Android watch and my phone. I also really appreciate that I can ask it to show the artwork on lock screen and then dim and blur when I unlock my phone to reduce visual clutter. 4 stars based on lack of customization on watch face. Would use daily if I could see the weather and battery level at a glance. I would also be totally impressed with this watch face if when it went into ambient mode you could still see a black and white contrasted version of the current painting.

Review 2: wonderful app  but how about...? making the archive a little easier to view and use? I can never see whatever it was that I had on my screen previously  even the very day before  for instance. It would sure be nice to be able to go back  look up the artist in question  save and reuse favorite backgrounds  send them to friends. One of the great things about Muzei is the wide array of artists used...not just Monet and Rembrandt...but if we lose them each day  never to be seen again  that's a pity. I can't even use the archive via the web...it's all blank! Thanks  and keep up the great work.

Review 3: Fantastic! ...unless you have certain phones I loved this app on my Galaxy S4. I would like to love it on my LG G4  but I can't use it. The G4 (and some others) interpret a double-tap as a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""knockON"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" code which immediately locks and turns off the screen - it can't be changed or disabled. Well  not without using yet another third party to circumvent it. If Musei could allow other gestures (three taps  two finger tap  etc) to be used  it would be useful to folks like me again. That issue aside  there are some great addons available for Musei!""""

Review 4: Great app  but what happened with the wallpaper scrolling? This is a pretty cool app I use exclusively with Nova Launcher and Muzei Reddit wallpapers on my HTC One M7  just for wallpaper scrolling. A few months ago before an update  landscape wallpapers were able to fit onto the screen without having to crop out portions of the image on the left and right edges. App is really good  but seeing how a majority of the wallpapers from my favorite subreddit can't be viewed as a full picture when scrolling anymore unfortunately makes me like this app a little less.

Review 5: Homescreen Works Great  Wear Needs Work Very enjoyable app. New wallpapers every so often are very refreshing. However I would like to see some better controls and settings for the Android wear portion. For example  I wish I could change the font or use an analog face. Additionally  there is no way to change the wallpaper change interval for the watch  and the wallpaper doesn't always refresh making it quite confusing. Finally  I don't know if I'm messing up  but I like my lockscreen and homescreen to match and there's no option to do that.

Review 6: Thank you for the response! That should always be worth at least an extra star  and frankly I have used and enjoyed this app for quite awhile. I like the Earth and Deviant Art choices  but I think I """"discover"""" the most with the original art wiki source. I wondered if some sort of """"random selection"""" algorithm was broken but hey  if your dude is feeling a twinge of national. pride I can get behind that. But dudes  French contemporary realism.... I liked this app until suddenly it is overwhelming me with Russian artists. Whatsupwiththat

Review 7: Great app  especially if you like your wallpapers to cycle. I actually don't use the wallpapers included with Muzei. What I love about this app is that you can use it with wallpapers you have stored on your phone or SD card or even wallpapers from an app like Backdrops and set them to change periodically throughout the day. This app performs admirably. I think the only things I'd change is having separate blur/dim settings for the lock and home screens and also having a setting to change the wallpaper as frequently as every 30 minutes.

Review 8: Great! But where's the watch face? I've been using this app for quite some time and it's replaced my need for any other live wallpaper! Using a mix of Tasker  Media Utilities  and plugins for Taskei  Bing  and Music I now have a wallpaper that automatically updates with currently playing cover art  and switches back to Bing's daily image if not! However  I've owned a G Watch since late December and have yet to see the Android Wear watch face as an option  despite having Android 5.0 on my phone and watch. What's the deal with that?

Review 9: Best wallpaper app I love this app. I really enjoyed the artwork but I have switched to using my own photos now. Getting a surprise wallpaper is so enjoyable. And the best part is that I can set personal family photos  but  due to the tasteful blur  no one else can really see them unless they know to double tap. So  I get to look at changing personal family photos every time I use my phone  but I don't have to worry about strangers or coworkers seeing family every time I use my phone in public. 5 stars. Best app on my phone.

Review 10: Use to love it. First  the GOOD. This app is the best wallpaper changer app that I have found. Cycle multiple images on regular intervals  blur and dim images to help see icons on launcher  rotates images if launcher can support it  and handles images of different sizes. Now the BAD  this app use to show the whole image and would adjust scrolling depending on the image size in landscape but now it won't go to the edges. Also the double tap feature is broken on Smart Launcher. Although I think this is the Launcher's fault.",5683,'net.nurik.roman.muzei' is a wallpaper app for Android watches.

net.osmand.plus,Negative,"Review 1: I bought OsmAnd+ when the navigation still worked somehow. I took an account that each newer version will provide more and more fixes and upgrades. But it worked totally different. With current release the navigation is totally disaster and useless anymore. The most I hate it now is very long time to calculate the route  it takes so much time that I can ride few kilometers and navigation is still in calculation. And when navigation lost the route it starts to calculate it again and it takes next minutes  where I can ride next few kilometers without map. It didn't work that way before. It is dissapointing considering the fact that google maps is free and has offline mode now (not full offliine  but it navigate much better). I don't know what filters You have implemented into it  but when I zoom map i clearly see that my car is off the road.

Review 2: Oncely in the past/former releases this app was promising a lot comprehensive features and reliability si I bought it with all extra parts as I intensively use it for much more than simple map. It has video notes geo-integration. However latest release has low readable  too small gps point and too small size poi names and a defective pois selection/disabling mode and hardly to remove/cancel navigation of previous route annoying current map...Even Worse...when Zoom In under 200m scale  Map dissapear unexpectedly...Also there is no more basic SEARCH by Address!?? It seems that its developers did not check with all Android releases!??...What a boolshit app has become here?!?

Review 3: I really wanted to like this app as an alternative to Google Maps or my Nuvi GPS  but even on the first few tries I was pretty disappointed. I did a test navigation to a known place and back  and it first warned me of railroad tracks that aren't there! Then  trying to enter a home address  no street numbers (""""""""""""""""Building"""""""""""""""" in the app) appear anywhere  and my neighborhood has been around for over ten years. Not very promising  and there was only one restaurant shown nearby in the area I selected  though there are quite a few there. I'll continue to look at it  but I'm sorry I paid for it (even with the Black Friday discount) instead of trying it out first.""""

Review 4: The app works well enough  once you figure out how it works. The description says it also works with Android Wear. However  in spite of everything I've tried on my phone and watch and several unsuccessful attempts to get additional information from the OsmAnd people  I get absolutely nothing on my watch. OsmAnd refuses to provide any instructions or other documentation and just keeps telling me the app is supposed to send directions to my watch but there's nothing on my watch. I'd steer clear of this one if you're looking for something for your watch  at least until they can provide some screenshots or something else that can prove it actually works.

Review 7: Maps have been used for centuries to find where you are going. Some thing map apps have not figured out. If I am looking for a place on a map  I should simply type and address in a search window  and that window should be right up front  as that is what I am looking at the map for. A simple operation  that any one can do online  but go offline  and they forget how maps work??? In OsmAnd I can be looking at a city on the map  but if I type it in a search  it's not found??? If your programming can't do this simple thing  it is wrong  simple as that......

In future please notify users of new perms + reasons

Review 9: Doesn't work with all external sd cards anymore After days of searching for a solution  it seems that OsmAnd does not support exFAT external sd cards anymore  since its August 11  2016 version (my Samsung micro sd card on a Samsung phone shipped exFAT). OsmAnd does not even show the card as selectable storage space! A FAT32 card instead of the exFAT I used for months without problem with OsmAnd  did work with new OsmAnd version. Other apps  including HERE  do not have this problem. Apart from that  OsmAnd is a good app.

Review 3: The app looks great  however if you try to skip the beginning inviting you download a map of the place it thinks you're at  you won't be able to see any map. You'll have to dig into the settings to find where you can download a map and only then will there be a prompt saying """"""""""""""""it looks like your base map is missing or outdated  do you want to download it?"""""""""""""""". There should be an obvious yes because without it the app is useless... And there's no explanation as to why the maps have to be downloaded and can't be streamed as typical maps applications do. A note about this would be important... Otherwise  apart from this major UX issue  app looks great!""""

Review 4: Great app  love the map details when switched to bicycle. Offline maps is also very helpful when out on the motorcycle in the country. You can alter your settings under 3 profiles of driving  bicycle  or walking. One bug I've found is after software update I lose settings like recording my track to gpx etc. I'm also trying to figure out how to add red light cameras for the community to see. Apparently this is done through openstreemap dot org and is a more complicated process than it sounds. So for this I still use WAZE when in the car and OSMand+ for cycling or motorcycling where reception can be shotty.

Review 5: Loved the previous version Since I installed 2.4 it gives me a map rendering error and screen stays blank. I hope this is fixed soon. After uninstalling and reinstalling it still didn't work. Left it for the weekend and repeated the uninstall  download new version and install  now it works just fine. Don't know what the issue or whether there was a software tweek over the weekend. New version only works with some SD cards and insight of what they say maps downloaded with old version do not render even though they are in the right place and are seen by the program.

Stable  the power consomptiom is correct even with the screen on max brightness! A lot of options to configure the softthe way you like it. The only improvement that I can suggest is to simplify the the menu structure that is not so easy to understand. For example: allow to disable the POI directly in the search.

Review 9: The most versatile GPS navigation ever. Just keeps getting better. Only wish that my phone had the TomTom chipset as only this can acquire satellites in our car and in forest areas and is the only reason I haven't binned it. As far as mapping and routing goes  a TomTom is frustrating and useless. Osmand+ just can't be beat on mapping or routing because you can tailor it to any form of travel. Once set up just choose the mode of transport and you will have the map details and appropriate routing for your actual requirements.

Perfect for ANY situation where a noise buffer is desired: studies  sleep (you or the baby!)  work & most importantly ANY time you desire a private conversation. Infinite noise combinations  wavelength  amplitude & volume control  app settings lock  settings save slots. All for FREE & zero adds!!

Review 4: Amazing. You can fine tune the audio to suit your needs. You don't just get white  pink or brown noise  you can get an entire spectrum. I suffer from Tinnitus so the ability to create an audio signal that I can use with my tinnitus and produce sounds that really do help me to sleep. I would give it more than 5 stars. It would be nice to be able to save an audio signal to an mp3 file of maybe up to an hour?

Review 5: This is the one to download No looping  no popping  no ads  no excess battery use  no excess permissions. Fully customizable sound that is leagues ahead of any 'similar' app. Only one suggestion: allow fine control of each individual bar. Still  can't say anything negative about this app.

Review 6: This is what I needed Of all the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""white noise generator""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""s out there  this is the only one that really generates noise and doesn't play whacky """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""nature sounds"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". It's simple to use and just works.""""

Review 7: I just installed the app and already know it will be amazing for relaxing and sleep. You can draw you own spectrum of sound  I prefer lower end brown noise in the 500mhz range....Awesome! Forget the rest this is the best  and tried quite a few.

Review 8: I Love It!! I usually need to listen to NASA space sounds to sleep but when my internet is out this is a life saver.I can make it sound pretty much like the magnetic fields of Ganymede or Neptune.Thank you for this awesome app!!!!

Review 9: The combination of suffering with tinnitus  and a great love of sound art  makes this app a good one to have. Its wide-ranging chromatic capabilities make it a very special one among noise apps. In short  I do indeed love it.

Review 10: Still the Best of the lot! Thanks Paul for creating and updating. This app is a part of my day  and I am grateful. Supports better sleep  concentration and especially handy at the dentist office too. :- )",3661,"Chromadoze is a free noise generator app. Users can create their own sounds to help them sleep.

Review 2: Wonderful! A thorough work has been done here - content-wise and design-wise. Thank you. Yishar Koach! 2 important things for improvement: (1) Ability to select language (other than device's default) (2) Even a slight hand-movement to the left or to the right  while sliding the screen up or down  causes a date-change (a move to a neighboring date). This is very annoying. EDIT: (1) Google prohibits the user from choosing (by himself) another language for the UI on his own device?? (2) Great.

Review 3: Thanks for fixing the Los Angeles  US issue. I have one more thing- I noticed recently  that I set up alarms and they work fine and great... at first.. A week later I just stopped getting notifications... I went back in unchecked and rechecked the check-boxes... they worked for a few days and now I haven't seen a zman reminder in over a week :(

Review 4: Love every MINUTE of it.Just 2 things to fix:What happens on friday when there are two candle lightings-one for chanuka and another for shabbos?About the widget maybe the whole daily time list of the next day can be seen from shekia or at least after nightfall qnd not just from midnight.

Review 5: Just works Works with ease as you would expect it to. It knows where you are and tells you the proper zmanim. Has more advanced features too but I just live that it has it all. Examples: when the fast ends  lighting times and the other expected zmanim.

Review 6: I like how you can set the opinion for each zman to jibe with your local community. I also like the notifications  although the notification for nightfall isn't working--I'm davening at plag  and would like an alarm when I can count the omer.

Review 7: GREAT APP I think its even the most useful app in Judaism that I know. Great work! The only thing I think you need to improve is to make in the settings opition to make the app in Hebrew.

net.somethingdreadful.MAL,Negative,"Review 1: I installed this software and it was only a list management app  exactly like it clearly says! I demand it meet my clearly unreasonable expectations of watching the anime for me! How dare you release something that doesn't do what you don't say it will! Seriously though  I'm giving it 5 stars just to balance out the idiots that can't read before making demands for free anime. The app itself works pretty much exactly as you would expect a MAL client to do  so it probably deserves the 5 anyway. Also  turns out it only dislikes a couple of special characters  not all.

Review 2: ? When I went into the app  this is the first thing I saw : which site do you prefer ? My anime list / Anilist. The next thing I saw was written in red ! You cannot watch anime or read manga. Read the first line in the store description ! I was confused then chose my anime list. It came out somebody had used my gmail account for their own personal use and when I chose create account  it suddenly went to a website !

Review 4: Good  but.. My complaint is that it keeps scrolling up or down because it thinks I'm hitting the scroll bar and not the menu button for updating the chapter I'm on.

Review 7: Once again Atarashii! has locked me out of my account. Cross checked my MAL account on my PC and all is fine there. I have uninstalled several times only to get a window stating """"check your credentials"""". Unfortunately for me  there is little else out there to replace Atarashii and when it works it is my preferred app for MAL. This has happened five times in the past six months.

Review 8: Good app overall but as of recently i cannot use it  every time i try to update a series it asks me to update my MAL password that i never changed in the first place.

net.somethingdreadful.MAL,Positive,"Review 1: Nice  clean and simple MAL client. Something Dreadful has created Something Awesome. Sync is fast for me  (wifi  40mbit)  no startup issues on Android 5.0.2. Only one suggestion so far: Add a +1 button to the anime tile instead of in a submenu  and change the sub menu button for +1 to the dialogue to change the watch count and status. In my case  as I update MAL not every watched EP i'd have to tap+slide trough roughly 5 screens to get to the watch status and EP count  which IMO should be easier to reach. Also  maybe a feature request system in-app with a list of requests and request progress if being worked on  and a vote system could help for either only the beta  or both beta and release version.

Review 2: Good but... Ok  the app is great. I really love it. The design and everything is perfect. It might be my phone  but when I open the side menu and I click on one of the options  it goes all white and it takes 5minutes to load the results. In the end  it doesn't even work. Same goes for the search. It wasn't doing this before so i doubt its my phone. I tried redownload the app and everything and the problem is still there. My lists are fine and everything linked to my account works great. I can't browse if you want

Review 3: I don't know that it's a bug or not..... Whenever I disable this app (for hiding purposes) and then enable it .....it asks me to login again.....and it's kind of tiring for someone who can't remember passwords(like me).....and many times I have to change my password to a new one..... If it's a normal behavior for the app then please ignore..... I will just try to learn my password....lol......Other than that....it's a very good app.....delivers more than what it promises....I like it a lot...;!

Review 4: Could Be Better Aside from the minor negative of the Holo-esque sliding tabs  the app just needs to create more efficient use of space. The anime pages are fragmented into multiple tabs  with little information displayed. The general Material Design elements are very much appreciated  but there is further work to be done in that regard. (*nudge* You could add an option for light cards for the main pages! *wink*) Nonetheless  it's a good MAL client!

Review 5: Progressing! (Bug Report) When I add (+) an anime to my list and slide down to refresh the anime's page  it resets to its initial state  so it'd be good to use the slide down event to save besides the 'back' click.. button whatever. Nonetheless great app! EDIT: I'm aware of the HTTPS switch MAL did and I was worried it might cause some problems  but it seems that you're handling everything perfectly  thanks again.

Review 6: Great ! I love Atarashii's layout  it's simple and useful. Thank you for fixing the glitches. (^_^) But if I can give a suggestion  you could add things like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Start Date/Finish Date"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and an easy way to find relative stories (sequels  side stories  etc) so we can know if the anime/manga we're following has some kind of continuation. Thanks in advance and keep up the good work ! (^_^)""""

Review 7: Hi there. I use MAL. Today  I opened the app to update my list but then the Manga List wouldn't show anything. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. Still nothing. I synced it a couple of times too. Still blank. The only thing affected is my Manga List. The Anime List is working just fine. I have a very stable internet connection too. Could you please help me find the problem? Thanks so much. :)

Review 8: I love it This app is pretty useful ! I use it everyday. It will be good to have possibility to sort completed animes by start or finish date. (Reply : but it's possible on our MAL list). Even when update dates automatically is disabled  the app often replace the dates with the current day  so we lose our data  please fix it ! It seems the app sometimes forget to send dates.

Review 9: By far best MAL app Great app  very useful. Only issue I have is the personal info page  it seems like sometimes it ignores the info I put in  even on the latest version. Maybe consider having a discrete """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""update info"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button at the bottom of the page? It would be useful  cause I'm not really sure when/if my change is getting saved to server.""""

Review 3: Awful UI  Forgets Preferences I keep coming back to this app  hoping that the developer has fixed its problems; again I'm disappointed. First  the UI is and always has been complete garbage. What's with the tiny buttons that all look alike? Why must I press one of these idiot miniature buttons to switch between stills and video? Video should be a freaking giant button. Second  whenever I set manual focus the app reverts back to autofocus on restart. Useless! Third  the camcorder records the """"""""""""""""bing"""""""""""""""" at the beginning of each clip! So dumb.""""

Review 4: Kinda love it  but I've got some trouble. When I'm looking for camera so with manual focus and light intensity capability I find this one interesting and it turn out to be good. I love this simple camera app and I used it often until I find something bugging me. There's something wrong with its video recorder. The video HD resolutions got an 16:9 screen ratio but when I record the video it's on 4:3. When the video saved  this puny 4:3 forced to be a 16:9 and awfully stretched. Tell me what's the workaround of this problem or fix it on next update.

Review 5: The only free app for pro shooting This app has many important features like pro. But some of its features really bugging me...1) It shoots b&w photos of focused objects though my phone has fully raw capability. 2) The resolution is quite low(of 12mp highest only in back camera) though my phone has 16mp back camera module. 3) In video recording(UHD) it has same problem(8mp max). Two important features are missing. 1)The inbuilt gallery app for editing and enhancing(for both raw and jpeg). 2)Camera can't capture photo in lossless PNG format.

Review 6: No SD Card saving = epic fail One if the main features of the Android phone over apples phones is the SD Card Storage option. Most Android phones come with low amount of internal storage for this reason. This apps inability to save to SD card is nothing less than an epic fail. And with multiple comments to this issue means the dev team is unwilling to make the modifications that IMO are mandatory in today's world where video and pictures are such high quality that storing them on internal storage not only impractical  but impossible!

Review 7: Probably the best but it's painfully SLOW and missing an important option. I've used literally dozens of cam apps  if not all of them. My tablet has a crappy camera and this app works the best for it  though there are still minor bugs and it still misses the option to take flipped (corrected) pics from the front cam. This app is almost perfect but it takes SLOW pics. Takes 2-3 seconds to snap a photo: tap  freezes  captures  done. WTF? All other apps take the pic in 1 second! Option to use it from the lock screen doesn't work!

Review 8: What's the point? I downloaded this for my dual cam Huawei P9 hoping for better controls than the stock app. There's no extra controls that would take advantage of the monochrome chip and even the Panorama mode is weirdly accessible only from video mode like in the stock app. I don't care how it works in the background  just move the freaking thing to camera mode. Having said that  I understand that this is a free app with no ads  but if it brings nothing new or appealing to the game then I have to ask - what's the point?

Review 9: It was great Really great camera option  until recently. Now when i take a photo  the finished shot fills the screen and you cant get rid of it.. You have to close out the app to get it to clear.. and while its there you can shoot another shot but you cant see through to what your shooting.. This couldn't have been intended..

Review 2: A very useful app for stamping location information on to photographs. This could be immensely helpful for anyone involved in any sort of field work. It would be good to have some alternatives to the default positioning of the stamp in the bottom right of the image. Using the phone's microphone to trigger the taking of photos is also useful for field work. I found that the saying 'cheese' option worked well but the 'loud sound' trigger didn't (even at high sensitivity). That's a pity because I would rather use some other sound trigger than 'cheese'  e.g. a whistle. Again  from a field work perspective  it would be good to be able to record a brief linked voice annotation/note with each picture because that would provide an efficient way of adding additional context information to the picture. That would be much better than a simple text annotation which would quickly become a pain if taking multiple pictures on a field trip. Adding voice annotation  however  would require the willingness of the developer to extend the app a bit more in the location awareness arena  e.g. storing location waypoints and linked media (photo  audio  text) in  say  GPX format for use in other apps.

Review 3: To other Reviewers  please don’t denigrate this terrific App by deducting Stars for missing features  or features that don’t work right with YOUR particular Smartphone & OS  ... OR because you can’t figure out how to use some feature! It’s not fair to the Developer and could cause a User who really needs it  to pass it over. After spending a year with a S6 Camera that can’t focus or expose correctly  trying and using over 6 different Apps  I for one am very grateful that I found this App. HANDS DOWN the best Camera App I have EVER used. And  NO Ads whatsoever! In the FREE version no less! How rare is THAT these days. Finally  I have found a Camera App that works like it should. I don't have to take 20 or 30 shots anymore just to get ONE that I can use. Open Camera NAILS it almost every time! WOW! Many Great Kudos to you  Mark Harman. What you have done here should light the way for other Devs to show how this should be done. HIGHLY Recommended App. I am SO happy to buy your Donation App! Thank you Sir!

Review 4: Really wanted for this to work for me as I've had good luck with my Nexus5 camera when travelling  but wanted to add RAW capability. However  no dice on the HDR mode. Even after disabling """"""""""""""""Enable HDR Burst""""""""""""""""  I can't get even passable HDR images under controlled circumstances. Shot back/back photos of a mixed background  in good light  using native Android HDR and OC HDR. OC's images all plagued by blurriness that looks like mis-alignment between the exposures  whereas native camera app renders clean and even correctly balances very high-contrast fields like shadows vs backlit monitors  etc. I like the nature of this offering  and all of the configurability is great. Will check back with it periodically  but since I do a lot of HDR shooting for straight-to-social media  etc.  it's not worth the tradeoff with the current behavior. v1.36.2 app on Nexus5 running Android 6.0.1""""

Review 5: This is a simple yet effective application and I use it mostly for video recording and it gives great results. My phone lacked features like changing exposure and tap to focus while video recording but this app made it so easy to use. The one problem is that the flash doesn't turn on while video recording and I didn't try to click pictures using the flash. I've tried many settings but none of them gets the flash to work. It's kind of random. Sometimes it will work and sometimes it doesn't. And it works sometimes only in auto mode. And just to be clear the flashlight of my handset is fine and has no issues. The default camcorder can use the flash to shoot videos. I'll be glad if the developers can see to it if there are multiple reports like this.

Review 6: 4.8 stars if I could! Excellent camera app... Best I've found so far. Why? It's basic  straight-forward and FREE! MAIN REASON) It only takes a photo AFTER it focuses!! My Lenovo takes a LONG time to finally focus and often changes when you press the shutter. It's really annoying. This app. avoids that and takes a quality photo every time as it locks the focus before it takes the photo. Brilliant... The only app. I've seen do this so far. Improvement Possibilities... 1) I had NO luck at all with the audio triggered shutter... Even shouting! Could we have the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Peace sign fingers"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with a timer  please? 2) Could you put the HDR button on the main screen? I use it a lot if outside. Thank you so much. Loving it so far.""""

Review 7: 4 stars instead of 3 as the developer is not making or attempting to make money and it works very well  a few minor issues  my phone records sound in stereo and I've noticed that often only 1 of the sound channels has been recorded whilst using video. Monophonic phone users won't be affected by this  but those of us who purchased stereophonic phones for realistic all round sound may not be happy. Small sensor in phone so it's not a dslr or apsC type sensor so don't expect drastic improvements and you'll be happy. Can make your photo taking experience better than your stock camera app if used correctly and you understand how to use the features

Review 10: This application let you control almost everything for your shot. It's great  especially because is totally free and with no ads. The only thing I would like the team to improve is the UI. Is just really basic and some functionalities are not fast to get to (focus mode for example). Maybe having a separate button for every single aspect of the settings (Focus  Metering  Exposure) and a separate one for locking Exposure and Focus would be wonderful. If there's a way of providing feedback (email or similar) just let me know. Overall  I think the best quality/price app I've found at the moment",8416,Net.sourceforge.opencamera is a free app for Android. It lets you stamp location information on to photos. It also has a real-time toggle switch from camera or video modes. The app is free and there are no ads on the site.
net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp,Negative,"Review 1: This app is the worst over bluetooth!! It just downloaded the same song 793 times in a row  consuming 4GBs in background usage!!! That alone just cost me $30 with Verizon. I guarantee that it's due to the newest Android software update that was just pushed out this morning. In addition  it automatically starts up upon bluetooth connection no matter what settings are chosen. I've used this app with different Android phones in 3 different cars and it does the same thing almost every time. This app will screw you badly with your cell provider if you don't turn off background data.....which renders the app pointless. Good luck!!

Review 2: Android KitKat breaks Subsonic I have 6 GB stored in the SDcard\Subsonic\music\ folder. I spent months trying to figure out why Subsonic was not seeing my music  and only today discovered why. It is a shame that a KitKat update (SDcard unwritable) broke SubSonic. Sindre Mehus  I hate to do this to the best person in the world  but your app is no good for me now... ONE Star for what was once a SIX star app because you do not have the option to write to your own folder on the SDcard. Declare permissions to SDcard\Subsonic\ as owned by Subsonic and let us write to it with our cache.

Review 3: 5+ gigabyte data usage in one day? I unknowingly ran through 2/3 of my monthly mobile data plan allowance in a matter of hours by running this software. I had a similar subsonic app on my iPhone and never had anywhere close to that much data usage. Did it try to download my whole library in the background? Seems to me like a major bug/issue. I used the default settings  so I'm not aware of doing anything wrong on my end... Update: I looked in my server logs and found one track being requested from the server over and over (and many many times per minute).

Review 4: WARNING: Data Hog - My phone's data usage has gone through the roof during periods when I barely listen to 3 different songs. In the last week it's used over 1GB of data  and I've listened to only 4 different songs. Songs I've just played in the last 10 minutes will buffer  play for 20 seconds  then stop and buffer again even though I just finished playing it once. There's a definite problem. Until it's fixed  I'd steer away from using this unless you have truly unlimited data or only use on WiFi. Going to try UltraSonic player now.

Review 5: Make Audio focus support optional With the new """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Audio focus support"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in ver. 4.4  the music keeps pausing when using a running app - I guess because """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""another app requires focus  for instance route guidance."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" But I care less about getting my distance right than about having the music streamed seamlessly. I keep having to pull my smartphone out of my carrier belt  turning it on  and hitting the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Play"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button. A great app otherwise.""""

Review 6: Not working correctly after update I've used the Subsonic for about a year (and loved it) - then I upgraded my Galaxy s3 to Android 4.3 and the metadata is no longer syncing correctly with my car stereo. I get the correct info. for the 1st track played  but then that info. stays on the screen no matter how many other tracks get played. I've attempted to get help via email  but gotten no response so far (2 weeks and counting). What was a 5-star rating is now 3 - at least the controls still work ... so far).

Review 7: What happened? There is a serious problem with Android release 4.3 of Subsonic.  I upgraded to this version last night  and overnight accumulated over 10GB worth of data charges (yes- 10GB).  This is way more than I typically use in 3 months  and I am being charged &gt; $100 USD for this overage.  My player was not being used at all at this time  and I had it next to my bed charging. I verified that the data usage was associated with Subsonic. I would normally rate this a 5. Please fix this ASAP.

Review 8: Audio ducking still broken Despite version 4.4 claiming to have fixed it  audio ducking is still broken for me (app version 4.4  Nexus 6P  Android 7.0). While Subsonic is playing  if anything else plays a sound  like Google Maps for example  Subsonic still sets all system audio output to like 15%  instead of just its own output. Everything else is great  this is just a really frustrating (yet minor and easily fixable) bug  that really should have been fixed a loooong time ago.

Review 9: Ignore  move on Do not buy. Needs an overview of local 'pinned' music. Little button at edge of screen is hard to use. Needs pinned/not pinned at album overview. No need to jump into album after pinning. Cannot change cache location. Buigs are in the app for months or years? maybe. Could use 'syncing 3/18' message somewhere. Could use 'pin to device' server-side. Would be nice to have Headphones (application) integration. Cache broken. No support. Dead forum.

Review 10: I've been a subsonic user for many years and while the sever application has been receiving updates and new features  the app has remained stagnant. I have tried the 3rd party apps and still prefer the interface of the official app; however  there are a few issues. Certain aspects of the app are buggy. Using subsonic while also trying to navigate with Google Maps is problematic  and the options for podcasts  and playlist editing within the app would be nice.",5379,Android KitKat update (SDcard unwritable) broke SubSonic.

net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp,Positive,"Review 1: I have a 4.4.2 KitKat phone  and it won't let me put any apps on the SD card  however  since SubSonic updated  the default folder is on the SD card properly. They added unlimited preset servers! You rock! This app is now a bright shiny piece of gold! This is one of my most valuable pieces of free software on my phone/PC! I heard you can use your PC and make this work with Google ChromeCast too! If I could request 1 feature/modification it would be.... umm.... there is NOTHING I can think of!! A+ Job. *note:(unless it was updated) If users have problems with music not showing up  make sure all your music is in SUB-Folders  because they don't seem to show up if their in the root folder  such as if you add """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""c:\music"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as a media folder and have """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""c:\music\Song.mp3"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" then that song wouldn't show up  but """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""c:\music\fun\song.mp3"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" will  because it's in 1 folder deeper than you typed in the java web setup  which was """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""c:\music\""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Review 2: What can I do about the reboots? This has been my go-to method for playing music on my mobile devices for years. I love the server product (purchased long ago)  and the mobile app has always been great. However  since I upgraded my phone (T-Mobile Galaxy S4 - M919) to Kit Kat the app has been unusable for me. It works for a few tracks and then spontaneously reboots my phone. This happens when using wifi or mobile data connections. I've cleaned all of my settings  did fresh installs  factory reset my phone  formatted my SD card (although Subsonic is using the internal storage)  etc.  and I still get the reboots. I see that others are having this problem as well. I'd really like to find some information about how to resolve this. I rely on my Subsonic server heavily for music. This will be a 5-star review when I can get this resolved.

Review 3: Awesome App! You won't find a better server/client music service anywhere that offers the features that Subsonic does. I have been running Subsonic for a few years now and I can say with my hand on my heart it has never let me down. I have full control of my media through it  and can even decide what bandwidth each individual user will receive. You will not find the level of customization with any other music streamer. I highly recommend you download the Sindre Mehus version of the Subsonic app to get the best out of your server. I also highly encourage you to donate (as I have done)  the dev has done a great job  and giving him some beer tokens means he can only keep making it better.

Review 4: Downgraded note since ads  but very good app A bit disappointing to be asked to pay again when you already paid for the server.. And the way it's done (ads added via upgrade  ad removal suggested through in-app purchase) feels like a trap to make you pay  enough to make me gladly pay for another app which offers lock screen controls (Dsub). Other than that  the app is very nice since the latest upgrade  has a more """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Holo"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" skin which looks good on android 4.x  and is pretty fast and reactive (improved over releases)""""

Review 5: Very good audio player This is a solid player that let's you access you or a friend's music collection on the go. Many great features. My one suggestion (if I didn't just miss the feature) would be to give more control over the playback buffer. For example when a song is playing it will often pause to buffer. It would be nice to say don't start play back until 1mb or 1 minute of playback is available. There may be protocol limitations that prevent this feature  but if not that's one for my stocking this Christmas :)

Review 6: :-) Thanks for an excellent app! The server is getting better all the time - """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""radio"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is excellent - playing a selection like the artist I'd searched for. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Pin""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""ning tunes works well so I can play media when I have no signal on the underground. The player bandwidth option is useful  too (except my little old server gets busy transcoding). If it didn't keep putting gaps at the beginning of newly downloaded tracks  I'd give it 5 stars.""""

Review 7: Missing a couple key features Note: this is a great app and I love Subsonic  I just have high expectations for a media player. Missing: - ability to star songs from Play queue - ability to view """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""recently played/added"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" by song. - chromecast support The second being a Subsonic issue in general  not just the app. Also  the playlist features have improved but are still not where they need to be.

Review 8: No longer usable Ever since my wife and I upgraded to our Galaxy S6 Edge+ and Note 5 devices  we both experience frequent """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""blips"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""skips"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" with Subsonic. This happens whether using this Subsonic app or DSub  so it us something with the Subsonic server back end. I know it's not our devices because I've installed Plex and have zero issues with that service. We'll be paying for a Plex subscription going forward.""""

Review 9: Nearly Flawless Subsonic is how I have access to my entire multimedia anywhere I have internet access. It doesn't matter if there's only 16gb of storage on my device  I'm bound only by my Subsonic server's capacity. That's somewhere in the neighborhood of 4tb. While there are some flaws like ID3 tags not syncing properly from my computer's player  these are minor. Subsonic has ongoing development  continues to get better  and the kinks eventually get worked out.

Review 10: Love you long time I've used subsonic almost 5 years now. It's my life love. This app is good. I really miss the ability to specify cache location. I think this is a new android issue not allowing apps to save to SD c?rd. Silly. It would be nice if in the library section if one of the options for folder was local android files. If this was the case I would not need another music app as well. The flow and layout is great.

I certainly don't remember having to do that in the past. But the reinstall didn't change the problem regarding no updated statistical information  which problem persists. I'd like to revert to a working version of the app  say 2.15 which worked fine: how to do that?""""

Review 2: It's great  until it breaks Every now and them it refuses to upload my scans. The only work around I've found is to uninstall then reinstall. Kinda sucks. Usually happens when I get huge numbers as in tens of thousands  in a single day. But  after deleting wigle and all files associated with it off my phone  again  I'm just going to assume their upload server went down this time. Would be nice if they had coherent error messages instead of html code.

Review 3: Good app but with some annoying bugs I have a problem with the max database marker that pins it to a dismally low figure and nothing I do seems to fix it. I understand that having a max marker may be some sort of feature but after a moment's thought  I can't think of scenario where that would be useful to a user of this app  but maybe it will occur to me in the next 5 minutes or some other time I'm wardriving for a strictly limited quantity.

Review 4: On my S5  I was getting a screen overlay error after install. The app would start  then not display anything. After messing around with screen overlay permissions  I discovered that no permissions had been granted tot he app on install. Not sure if I had skipped that part of the install  or if the app did not fully install. After assigning correct app permissions (to wifi  phone and storage) it works as advertised.

Review 2: Gave it another chance It's still not a perfect app  but I tried it some more and it hasn't locked up my phone like the first time. I really wish it wouldn't constantly set itself to turning on lockon  and wouldn't keep GPS on even when scanning is turned off. Still  it's a useful and interesting way to take the pulse of your neighborhood and routes. Give it a shot and upload your results  you might be surprised by how much free Wi-Fi you find.

Review 3: I can't help but be just a bit excited when driving to a new area to see all the new Hotspots. I hope Google  Skyhook etc are actually using this data to reduce the need to use GPS for a good location. Your phone seeing multiple WiFi networks around you should give you more than a precise enough location for more or less everything except navigation.

Review 4: Very good (free) app for seeing wifi ssid's. I have had 0 crashes over the last two months and performance is as good as the day I installed it (because it uses SQLite database). +Free +Free upload to website to see what data you captured OR what everyone captured. +No performance problems as it uses SQLite database. +No crashes (ever) for me

Review 5: Great app It allways amazing just how many open networks there are still about. !!!!! Just one thing..... PLEASE change the voice or use the Google voice API it drives me bonkers. I'm also interested in what the data is used for. It would be great to know that I am helping improve location accuracy via WiFi. Keep up the good work. :-) :-) :-)

Review 6: Great wardriving app  could do with more Wigle integration The wardriving and mapping side works very well  but I'd like to see more use of the whole Wigle database - like being able to search it for an SSID  comparing my results with theirs etc. It so needs one single tickbox for 'never make any noise  ever'.

Review 7: Interesting insight This awesome app has provided me with hours of entertainment and insight on where all the wifi is. I love the information that's dictated by the voice (despite what other say) and the fact that you can turn it off on demand with a single touch. Keep up the good work people.

It can be transferred between phone and computer easily with file manager (most phone come with one) or lots of free apps available.

Review 2: After a long search for a stock widget i finally found the perfect little guy. 👍 I love it. I really like that it's widget only.

Review 4: Not Able To Use Customised Text For Smaller Widgets I love this app and have been using it for a long time. However last week the widgets disappeared on my phone and I guess it was an update. I set up the widgets again and everything works well EXCEPT that customised text doesn't seem to work on the smaller 2x2 and 2x1 widgets. There's no problem for 4x2 widgets.

Review 5: Not updating prices automatically This is a great widget. My only problem at the moment is that it doesnt update prices automatically. Need to always go and manually update. UPDATE Oct 22 2016: It works now. Some setting on my new phone that prevented automatic updates. Updating it now to 5-star!

Review 6: Great app! I use your app all the time to check my stocks. Having a widget is much better than having to open an app. I have one request : in my portfolio I have a stock that I purchased at 0.0006 and it is getting rounded to 0.001 can you increase the input field to four decimal places?

Review 7: Loved it before the new update. Hate only seeing four tickers max on a 2x2 block. Please have it adjusted to the new Android OS or undo this new change because even a 2x3 only lets me see 10 tickers max and it's all spread out. Don't like one bit. Loved it earlier before this happened

We give it the Device administrator access and it works perfectly alright  but when I lock the screen using double tap and try to unlock it again  I'm not able to unlock it through my fingerprint  rather I have to enter the pin everytime. Please look into these issues.

Review 2: Quality App Just what I have been looking for. Please I would like to know if their is a way I can prevent the app from opening application when that full name is typed. I want it to respond to only the alias. Is that possible? Also  the listen command needs debugging. My phone ? hang when I try to load a music. It also do not respond to the music commands. FINALLY  WHAT IS THE COMMAND TO ACCESS MY PHONE SETTINGS??

Review 3: A few bugs This app was amazing overall  but there were a few annoying bugs that I faced. First  the rectangles where the auto complete text options are located in do not change length to accommodate the length of the text. Second  when I type listen followed by a space the app crashes. Also  some commands aren't supported like pwd and I can't use options for the supported arguments. Hope you could work on these!

Review 4: Some bugs Listen command doesn't work  it's enough to type 'listen ' to crash the app when /sdcard/Music is empty  should be possible to play from external storage also  ie SD card  further more  no audio when playing with listen  second bug is  I have next lock screen installed and it makes the 'next' command not work  both next and Next launches next lock screen settings  gs5 sm-g900f with Android 6.0.1

Review 5: Settings buggy as hell Most settings follow the OPPOSITE of the statement (ie. true=false) and some settings when changed make commands not work at all  especially anything to do with the compareString function. I love the launcher but things like not being able to disable the 'keep in memory' notification make me constantly want to switch back to my GUI launcher. 5 stars if my problem is resolved.

Review 8: Nice app one problem however  i have an on board app named """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""help"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" which conflicts with the help command in this app  the only way i have noted to fix it currently is switch the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""compareStringForApps"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" between true and false which gives me the help command but breaks launching apps.""""

Review 9: Nice idea  unable to comment on whether expected functionality is present and complete because the interface is unusable at the most basic level. Every character input pops up a list of auto-complete suggestions that acquires focus  thereby requiring you to manually tap back into the text field if you'd rather complete the command yourself.

Review 10: The Music Player command isn't working on my Galaxy S7 Edge International Variant. Everytime I type 'listen' and then the space bar  the app crashes. Says it has unfortunately stopped. I gave all permissions to the application  everything it asked and did not. Please help me. I want to make this my primary launcher.",4036,The listen command isn't working. The double tap to lock feature is not working. Some commands aren't supported like pwd and I can't use options for the supported arguments. The app was amazing overall but there were a few annoying bugs that I faced.
ohi.andre.consolelauncher,Positive,"Review 1: Mobile phones are awful to use. Presenting the user with 100 icons to scroll through is designer laziness. This app throws all that out. You want to run WhatsApp  swipe 'whatsapp' and bang it's open. Want to open a browser  swipe 'browser' and it's there. This launcher is also blindingly fast. I love it. Great work! As I am a moon-on-a-stick kinds guy  features I would love to see: * the settings.txt file works on a Linux desktop  but not a phone. This really needs even a minimal interface; with help/hints on what the settings do * When guessing the appname  sometimes a space is swiped in and it autocorrelation 'w whatsapp' which of course does not load WhatsApps. Can single unknown token before an appname be ignored? * 'alias m=AquaMail'; I want to be able to create (and 'unset') aliases in the UI * 'apps | grep foobar'; does a fuzzy string/description search * Some appnames should be hidden ('AquaMail unlocker') and other launchers honour those settings

Review 2: 6/28/16 I love the simplicity/speed using this as my main launcher. I've got an alias """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""nova"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to return to GUI when I feel like it. Flash  call  & my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""sms"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" alias are super handy. All installed apps launch quickly/easily. Unfortunately  most of the shell commands don't work yet. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""ping"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""traceroute"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" do nothing  and there's many more that don't function. Being able to swipe instead of tap in SwiftKey would make this ten times better. Something like cowsay or just the apt-get moo cow (text pix) needed. GUI color picker would be nice. More """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""status""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""-type functionality would be awesome. Custom wallpaper would be nice sometimes  though the plain background is traditional.""""

Review 3: OMG !!! My dreams 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 awesome app I've ever seen in my life. No file manager   no music player   no Google   no play search.. no 3rd party app is required.. all at one stop and that too with commands 😍😍😍 loving this launcher like a hell. Well done developer 👏👏👏 SUGGESTION: 1.Google search is not working.. please fix that in upcoming versions 2. It's better we have a clear RAM I.e.  clear background apps command. That will be more helpful.. and it's even better it is getting root access to do a more functions. Actually I really like that # instead of $ 😁 3. Full screen please. I don't want that status bar pop ups 😑 4. What if $ text """"Thomas"""" that """" matter here """" Hope you understand this command Please implement them ASAP

Review 4: love having a command line-like launcher and its features. used nova launcher prime for years  found t-ui a half hour ago  and im never going back. already uninstalled nova. one small issue  however.. i cannot save the tui settings file. all i want is full screen  no notification  and to change my user name and then my phone will be absolutely perfect. will donate once i figure out how to save settings. edit: downloaded version 5.2 and used the native txt editor. it worked! full screen works! changed the user name and device name! disabled the notification! my phone is so sexy now! donated a few bucks  everyone else should do the same. the dev deserves it. thx Francesco!

Review 5: The coolest app I've ever use 😎 love it Total launcher customize the UI greatly  t-ui just hide the UI  makes the phone easier to use. I don't have to consider how to match the icon style with my background  or how I should set up my folder style. Only problem is that it does but fully support Chinese. The Chinese names are listed separately  it'll be better if I can just search by Pinyin  so I don't have to switch language searching for apps; this problem may exist for Japanese  Korean or any other languages that do not use Latin letters and I know it's hardly possible to support all languages  maybe language packs will solve the problem?

Review 6: One of the best launchers that I've ever used. Highly customisable  very fast  good predictive suggestions  light weight. Another thing that I realised after starting to use the launcher was that I'm no longer mindlessly opening apps like Facebook  Twitter or WhatsApp just because i see the icons on homescreen. I now need to mindfully type the app name (first few chars) to get there thus making it very effective. The search function and alias naming is amazing. Just one suggestion/question: is it possible to have the suggestion bar at the bottom empty till the time i start typing some function or app name?

Review 7: Works great! Love having a linux shell rather than a traditional launcher. Blows all the rest out of the water with it's simplicity. Donated a few bucks  everyone else should too! Thanks Francesco! One option I would like to see is the ability to hide or disable the history of commands used.. Or the ability to hide commands of most recently opened apps. Also  I found a bug with the launcher in landscape mode + keyboard disabled. All the text is at the top of the screen and you can't read anything. Looks like the launcher is compensating for where the keyboard is supposed to be when it is open.

Review 8: Like it so geeky. Need some improvements too. AM USING CM11 ON GT-I9082 AND THIS MAKE SOME REAL DIFFERENCE. ONLY ISSUE I HAD WAS STATUS BAR BUT WITH A COMMAND LINE IN TERMINAL I ABLE TO DISABLE IT .so now its just shell as launcher nothing else on screen. I can easily launch apps from it. Kinda cool thing. Here is command to disble status bar (service call activity 42 s16 com.android.systemui) no brackets. It also disble long press home button so only way to access a app is through shell.... And yeah this launcher hang on call command. Thats annoying.

When I click Refesh Inbox icon  it will reload all sms on inbox again  include dupticate. Eg: My inbox have 2 Sms. When I click refesh =&gt; It will show 4 SMS on inbox  when continue click refesh  it will show 6 SMS...It's bad. Please fix it. And please add option only reload sms not published or mark what is published to prevent publish again Thank you

Review 2: Was working before but now... It's blank screen.. No navigation menus... I can just goto settings page by clicking on menu key... Please fix this bug... Sometimes it does shows everything but many a times sms won't sync to server and it justs shows synced successfully... Just cross checked with server but the problem is in app...

Review 3: Disappointing. It insists on being set as the default SMS app  resulting in not receiving notifications for SMSs  it keeps resending requests to the server for the same SMS  It is not able to detect the server while setting up the web service even though the server is fine. Too many bugs and poor design

Review 4: Why must it be the default sms App It replaces my sms default app which isn't desirable. What happens if you have a dual Sim? Please put option to choose Sim card. Also the ui is very confusing. Top says synced but the list shows fail. If it's truly open source where is the code base?

Review 5: Great work but requires tweaking.... Crashes when trying to delete messages..no select all and delete... auto delete does not work....

Review 6: works only if your server responds with a json structured payload. Otherwise you'll be stuck trying to figure it out.

org.ametro,Negative,"Review 1: Can't exit map I used ametro a lot on my previous phone. Installed it on my new one and imported a bunch of maps. I opened a map and now I can't exit it anymore. I can't get back to the main menu. I tried the back and home button  swiping  gesturing  ... No go. I just end up at my home screen. Checked the site but there is no info on how to use the app. I'd like to go for 5 stars. But that's just not possible for an app I have to reinstall every time I want to switch maps.

Review 2: Bug bug  cannot change city I was looking for an android app to replace AllSubway that I loved using on iphone. I had great expectations on Ametro but uninstalled it five minutes after  as I could not come back from the map to another city. It was literally stuck even after several restart of the app. Disappointing. I was happy to pay Allsubway for a reliable service.

Review 3: Some maps particularly poor Downloaded this as it was one of the few that had map of Tianjin. Map is terrible  though - looks nothing like the metro here  is way out of date and doesn't show interchanges. I can't trust other maps if this one is so poor so now deleted. A shame as app shows promise.

Review 4: Would be useful if wasn't so buggy The map disappears if zooming  showing blank white screen with scrollbars. Map of Moscow metro is so outdated that I couldn't use it: new stations are missing  some of stations have wrong names. Choosing stations right on the map doesn't work too.

Review 5: Update Great app  but it needs updating  several countries I've travelled to have had comlete new lines built that are not here  and i can find no where to update..

Review 6: My new Android has no Settings button  so I'm unable to find routes. I used to love this app.

Review 3: Stuck on one map I had it on my Samsung S3 and it was great a 5 star but for my new Samsung S5 there is no way to change from one map to the another.

org.andglkmod.hunkypunk,Negative,"Review 1: Good  but... Loses a star for the fact that Theatre won't open in this app on my device because of an unreasonable screen size restriction (am now playing it in the Text Fiction app). Otherwise  just like Hunky Punk except without the dodgy permissions. EDIT: Okay  so by using a workaround I figured out that my issue was with the file  not this app. On that basis  I'm restoring your fourth star.

Review 2: Can't read some books I'm playing Anchorhead and there are some books that won't display (the Frazer history  for example). I'm also running into a memory leak when the transcript reaches a certain size where the keyboard will start to severely lag. Restarting the game with a clear log fixes that. Any helps with the readable issue would be appreciated.

Review 3: Great app but... I've been playing Infocom's Border Zone with this app but it gets stuck with the status line when watching the searchlights in the Border chapter to be able to get to the fence and proceed further. Could you please fix this? Otherwise best IF interpreter out there.

Review 4: How do I add other games? It won't give me the option to add and my file manager won't recognise the .z8 format. EDIT: Nevermind  the folder finally showed up.

org.andglkmod.hunkypunk,Positive,"Review 1: Better than the interpreters I've used so far. As with the other two interpreters I've tried with my Android tablet  I used Anchorhead as a benchmark. My first impression is a very favorable one! I like that it connects to IFDB and grabs images for games it recognizes  and that it looks for new games that you had downloaded every time you launch this app. Another big deal is that the Enter key does not double-echo  unlike with the other interpreters I used before. There's just one bug I've encountered. There are two places in Anchorhead where the Inform menu is put to use. The first time you activate a menu is fine  but if you activate the same menu a second time  the list does not populate. All said  I love this app  and I'll probably continue to use it until I get around to playing something where the menu bug becomes a deal-breaker. By then  there might be a bugfix release  so that might not be necessary.

Review 2: Great adventure stories waiting to be discovered... If you can look past the stupid name and the rubbish icon  you will discover that this is probably the best text adventure interpreter for Android. This app comes with some of the best adventure stories. If you're prepared to dig around online and put the downloads in the right place using an Android file manager  you will find many many more  all for free. If only the developers would integrate a database of additional stories (ifdb?) right into the app to make it easier for less technically minded users.

Review 3: The best android IF interpreter I have used This is still a work in progress  but is the best interpreter for Android I have seen  and the only one I know of that supports TADS. HTML tads and/or graphics support and more formats will see 5 stars from me  as then it will be all I need for IF on my phone/tablet.

Review 4: Great app Has some good features and supports both z machine and TADS formats  has run everything I've thrown at it so far. Main improvement I'd make is to add options to change text and background colour  at the moment its not easy on the eyes but still  if you like interactive fiction you should get this.

Review 5: It would be nice to be able to change background and text colors but it hasn't bothered me. Glulx support PLEASE. Works great been enjoying the newer IF. I was a player of Zork back in 80's so I like the icon.

Review 6: I have loved text adventures since I owned my Commodore 64 computer way back in the day. This is an excellent app for playing text adventures. Thanks for a wonderful app.

Review 7: Updated! Thanks for the update! The TADS support is great  and I'm hoping that glulx support will be added sometime in the near future to this interpreter as well! :D

Review 8: TADS error Hey Dan  really appreciate your wonderful work here. The only problem I had is the TADS 1010 error I kept getting when resuming. Pls look into it  thanks!

Review 9: Great text interpreter for IF A solid player for multiple story formats. It comes with several quality games  and more can be downloaded through the IF database.

org.androidsoft.app.permission,Negative,"Review 1: Pointless Go to """"Manage apps"""" in your system settings  it does the same exact thing as this stupid app without wasting space or over exaggerating permission descriptions. APPS NEED THESE PERMISSIONS FOR A REASON! Do you really think devs are taking pictures of you in your sleep??? Maybe if you actually read the full app descriptions you would realize your notepad app needs the camera permission to import pics from your gallery... I've never seen a truly malicious app on the Play Store so stop being so paranoid!!!!

Review 2: What for??? What's the use of this app if u cant delete those unwanted permission? Just showing the permissions of all apps? Thats it? its just a common sense for all people. Before install an app. Make sure to take time reading its permission. Another app wasting battery life. Thats it! It runs in the background. Like hell of all you like this app. DUMBASSES

Review 3: Great app too bad about the rest of my apps I was unimpressed to find the apps that I had already downloaded because they needed no special permissions......had special permissions attached to them somehow. Just goes to show you what a deceitful world we live in these days

Review 4: Bullshit It said all my apps were bad! probably slowing down my internet. But i needed to keep some of the apps  which didn't ask for any of my permission. So i guess it's cool for starring other apps like prayers (red) and Shut Up Devil

Review 5: Useless since it doesn't let you change anything I see the app permissions. Now how about giving us some options to modify those permissions? In fact I think there's another app that does this way better but I forgot the name of it

Review 6: Worthless I'm running OmniROM on a rooted phone yet all this app does is list permissions. OmniROM does this by default. I wanted to revoke network permissions for apps. I guess I'll have to uninstall and try another app.

Review 7: Missing useful features. Needs to list ALL privacy exposures for an app (including ad libraries) & display a list of installed apps that have above average exposure for their app category.

Review 8: Where's Facebook Facebook is the main battery draining and intrusive app on my phone that I want to monitor  but it wasn't listed when I scrolled through my list of apps. Uninstalled

org.androidsoft.app.permission,Positive,"Review 1: Very Useful App A very good app  but the results need to be interpreted with care. Don't be alarmed if most of your apps are marked as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""dangerous"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". This is to be expected in most cases. For instance  the Lookout security app has a very high score because it needs access to almost everything. Of course it does  it's a security app! Also most developers want to know how you use their apps - for analytical purposes so they can improve them  so this generally means network access is required. Please use this app as a guide only. LJ  Norwich  UK""""

Review 2: Amazing app. The only reason I installed this app is because I am privacy seeker. And I can assure you that this app didn't let me down. It not only shows what permissions every app has access to  but also shows a severity score for every app and if you feel like the app is too severe for you  you can simply press the uninstal button right in the app. You can even filter the apps by permission  sort them by severity score or name which I believe every user will find it usefull. Totaly recommend.

Review 3: Great simple app  no adds  no permissions  and an easy way to see what permissions different apps are wanting. It would be nice if it could tell if a permission is denied for an app  and sort by the score based off only granted permissions. It would also be cool if for each app it gave a shortcut to its app information page in system settings  IIRC that can be done without root  and it seems odd that there's no button or link for that

Review 4: It's OK but Great for non-marshmallow users. However if you do have marshmallow it is necessary to distinguish between granted and blocked permissions. And changing permissions directly from this app would be nice too. Always a five star rating for no adds !!! Even though some of my apps are listed as safe but do produce irritating and sometimes aggressive (yes) adds.

Review 5: The good guide to permissions on your Android This is a very helpful app if  like me  you want to get to grips with becoming permission 'literate'. It is quite an education  a learning curve. This app is a little gem which can help you gain better awareness of the peculiarities of permissions - and to be savvy as a result.

Review 6: A must for those who have no clue what their apps have access to. If you're new to Android  or have never paid attention to the permissions your apps have access to  this app is a MUST. It's extremely easy to use and understand. You'll probably find yourself deleting some apps after using this! Lol.

Review 7: It's OK Good  but no score explanation (what does it mean and which number should worry me?)  no refresh  and doesn't list pre-installed apps (e.g. Google Slides on Nexus 6). Exemplary permissions (none)  no ads  totally secure. IMO best permissions advisor for Android.

Review 8: Must have app. Can't do without. Ignoring the permissions aspect is compromising ones mobile data security n privacy. One realises the most popular apps ask for most unnecessary permissions.Thank you developers for this app :)

Review 9: Not sure if good my app's I need to edit permission and even though it can it didn't for my galxy 3 Samsung. Okay a billion days later I finally went through all my apps and this really truly works guys! Great job S.E.

org.brandroid.openmanager,Negative,"Review 1: Appears to be abandoned Last update was in March 2015. It crashes too much and its FTP implementation (SFTP in particular) is extremely buggy. A shame because this application appears to be a promising alternative to adware (ES File Explorer)  and an alternative to another closed off file manager  which locks key features  such as FTP  behind a paywall (Fx File Explorer. Seriously? Even Windows does that out of box).

org.brandroid.openmanager,Positive,"Review 1: Excellent Concept App I would like to congratulate the developer to come out with such an excellent concept to explore the contents of the storage. I recently bought Google Nexus 7  32GB 3g/4G which got automatically upgraded to Kitkat 4.4.2 OS. I bought OTG cable to connect external SD Ram  and I am happy to see this app provide interface to the OTG connected RAM  as well as Google Drive in the same window  which makes easy transfer of data from one to another. However  when I changed the RAM card  your app is not refreshing the contents of the new SD RAM  so please correct this issue at the earliest.

Review 2: Powerful so far I like this file manager. I was only looking for a OTG USB app  but ended up keeping this cause it lets me explore almost every file and folder on the phone  even the startup animation and system sounds  etc. Powerful  but not sure if this enables the USB OTG drivers

Review 3: GPL ftw and feature request Nice to see an open source file explorer in here. I'd have one request though: I'd like to be able to open files stored on a remote sftp server with any app I want (VLC for instance). That's what I've been doing with ES for a while and it worked great.

Review 4: Good app Switched from now-bloatware ES Explorer... Looks great so far! Code accessibility is a big plus. Can't assign nonstandard sftp port or delete server entries  but this was declared experimental. Hope it improves still!

Review 5: Thanks to the developers Love it. Many of my problems have been solved due to this. I would like to give 10 stars but only 5 was available. Guys this app is absolutely useful install it. :) :) :)

Review 6: Best app ever This app worked for me .as my phone could not show the usb content after rooting using other tools this app came to my rescue ..so far the best .on my micromax unite 2 8 gb model

Review 7: Best OpenSource file explorer I love the app  lightweight  simple and efficient. One complaint  to myself  if only I could find the way to rename files with it... Hahaha

Review 8: Good! I love it as a file manager but I need to explore my USB Memory via OTG  but the app doesn't detect it :( please fix that and I'll love it!

Review 9: Fabulous And GPL! Awesome. It's be handy if the SFTP component allowed for use of keys though. Being password-only really limits your options.

org.connectbot,Negative,"Review 1: I have used this app for years  but some of the changes you have made recently just don't make sense. JuiceSSH works much better. I use Dyndns with pinhole ports through my router  my home Linux systems can be accessed either on a 192.168.1.x IP address on my home network or using an uncommon port on the Internet IP address of the router using PNAT to the correct SSH server. In my Connectbot  each server has two entries  one with its internal IP and the other with its Dyndns address. The icon functionality used to make some sense but now it does not. If you accessed a server successfully once before  it used to give a green tick by the server name  not it's a red exclamation mark. If a server hasn't been accessed for two days  it didn't used to matter on previous versions  the green tick would be there to show the last access worked. Now you get a """"No Entry"""" sign  which makes no sense. I also have a problem on my old Nexus 7 tablet on Android 4.3 where when I try to import keys that are in the internal storage  it goes straight to Amazon Drive to try to find the keys with no option to go back to the find them on the local device. It seems to be a backwards step.

Review 2: I used to use this when I had an old Linux version on my PC that did not support MTP for my phone and it worked great for connecting to Linux or a NetBSD shell account I have on the Internet  etc. But since I upgraded from a Samsung S3 to J7 this app does not even appear to have any way to allow me to add my ssh key that I need to use to connect to my Linux desktop PC or anything else (I normally disallow passwords in Linux to require keys only). When I try to """"""""""""""""Manage Pubkeys"""""""""""""""" it says 'Tap""""""""""""""""Menu"""""""""""""""" button to create or import key pairs'  but where in the world is a """"""""""""""""Menu"""""""""""""""" button on an Android (6.0.1) phone? When I try More > Import  it says """"""""""""""""Pick from /sdcard""""""""""""""""  but the only choice is """"""""""""""""Cancel"""""""""""""""". So it used to work great  but is now totally useless for anyone who wants or needs to use keys instead of passwords  since there is no way to select a key file from internal storage or microSD (sdcard). So while I used to like this app  it is currently non-functional for me at this time.""""

Review 4: The latest update from this week is the worst one I've ever seen  it makes the app usage basically not possible. Please return the previous version it worked. Now it does not allow self signed certificate keys  which means you cannot connect it to any hardware device which do not have external certificates  especially home routers. Who will pay hundreds or thousands dollars for a certificate to connect to home router??????

Review 5: Almost Perfect - but I can't import my key?! Please allow import key again. I know it works before but right now it just did nothing after I select the private key file. == Update == no fix for several months  I'm going to switch to a different app. This is not the only SSH client and not even the best one... No reason to keep waiting.

Review 6: I for the life of me cannot get this app to communicate with any server other than a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""local' connection. I connect to the servers just fine. The keyboard comes up  and nothing. I can't believe I am the only person that has this problem  but nothing comes up in google searches.""""

Review 7: Does what you expect andfits my needs for a console ssh client. One annoyance on the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet is that editing a host is not usable; the original configuration screen doesn't show up and what does is utterly garbled. I ended up deleting my host configurations and recreating them.

Review 8: Worked great till the latest update  now pageup/pagedown swipe scrolling are broken even with them enabled in settings and terminal scrolling and resizing in general seem a bit buggered. I am jumping ship to another ssh client at this point  you guys keep breaking things and I am tired of it.

Review 9: Very useful  works as described. Time since last use doesn't work properly on latest version  a very minor inconvenience. The new copy-and-paste tool  while aspirational in design  does not work well at all. The region definition cursors do not follow my touch (Samsung Galaxy 4  v4.4.4).

org.connectbot,Positive,"Review 1: What a difference an update makes... For awhile  ConnectBot had fallen behind.. No updates  dubious behavior with Bluetooth keyboards and some unusual ui quirks.. Well  I can't say it's now quirk free  but I can say that in terms of core features provided  it's definitely catching up to JuiceSSH. One particularly nifty feature present in ConnectBot that's a pay feature in JuiceSSH is port forwarding.. Very helpful when wanting to quickly check things behind a firewall... Now if only Android browsers made it easier to set custom proxies...

Review 2: Sweet & Simple! I love this app. It is open source  absolutely free and functional! It's sweet and simple and quite frankly all that I need. Other ssh apps are nice and all but I don't need all that extra functionality for simply ssh-ing into and managing my DigitalOcean droplets. Plus if I need more functionality I can simply modify the source code adding what I need and simply send it upstream for others to enjoy as well. 5 Stars for such an exceptional open source app that I use almost daily!

Review 3: Potentially the best app Google Play has seen. With a rating of 4.6/5 over 41000+ ratings it must be good. As a server admin I've used Putty for years and lives in my system32 folder. I must say  this is fabulous going mobile. I'm perfectionistic and one feature I'm missing is being able to locate RSA keys in folders other than the Android 6.0 downloads folder. Please also provide me with assisstance linking Puttygen RSA keys as it tells me its erroneous. Keep up the good work. Thumbs up.

Review 4: Long time user Just had to refresh my rating  this app is amazing  it's rock solid  and does everything you want with SSH  even tunneling.The keyboard has improved over the years  and is ultimate! Now that the arrow and ctrl keys remain present for multi presses  for touch only keyboards  it makes navigating around the screen simply and easy. Well done for the years of free access to simply the best SSH app on Play!

Review 5: Skip this; get VX ConnectBot! Since a recent update  ConnectBot keeps an annoying icon at the top of the screen  taking up valuable screen space. Because of this  I started looking for alternatives and found VX ConnectBot. This is a fork of ConnectBot with better UI. And multiple connections! Thanks for developing ConnectBot  but the future of this program now appears to be the VX fork. Such is open source!

Please fix this so I can rate five stars for what is otherwise a great app! Thank you!

Review 7: Great App I use this to connect to compute servers primarily to monitor jobs. One improvement I'd suggest is better screen management with landscape orientation. I like the volume control to change screen text font. I can't still figure out how to vertical scroll the screen. No sliders. Very very good tool with a few limitations. Scp up would be good too.

Review 8: Really good  but... This app is always my go-to app for using ssh on the go. It works really well and all the core features I use are there. But it's missing a couple of things: 1) a way to get a fullscreen of the terminal without the connectbot action bar  2) a simple way to change the color scheme. I hope you can fix these issues soon  thanks.

Review 9: Minor error / issue /problem. This app has served me well for many years. I use it to tunnel into my VPS on a regular basis. I'm having a minor issue where the second password box won't come up if I'm using challenge authentication unless I back out and click the connection again. (I use two factor with libpam-google-authenticator)

org.cprados.wificellmanager,Negative,"Review 1: Droid Turbo 2 and/or Marshmallow OS issues Long story short  I am very sad to say that with my Droid Turbo 1 on Lollipop dying and now I am on the DT2 with a fresh  clean install of Marshmallow  every other app is fine  but this one doesn't work. Every single phone and app setting is properly tweaked. It will NOT turn on and off based on cell phone tower triangulation. This app has not been updated since Jan. 2016 and it is June 2016. The technology is not playing nice. If this continues I must abandon the app and use another. Please fix guys!!!

Review 2: Doesn't work on my HTC1 (Update. Tried this a second time. No improvement. WiFi stays on all the time.) Does NOT work as described. All it does is keep my WiFi on all the time  draining my battery. Nothing more. I emailed the developer for help and he sent a nasty  unhelpful response complaining about my rating rather than helping me. His response below doesnt apply because my WiFi never turned off no matter where I was. Bottom line is program doesn't do what it's supposed to on my phone. It may work on others but not mine.

Review 3: Was such a great app but .... This was such a great app until recently  and I'm not really sure if its the developers 'fault' as there hasn't been an update since 16 December 2013. However  recently my phone started randomly turning the screen on even when there was no notifications to display. Using """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Wakelock Detector"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" I was able to work out it was Wi-Fi Matic. Shame :( - 5* when I didn't have that problem. Sadly now only 3*""""

Review 4: Pretty useless Turns Wi-Fi on unnecessarily  drains battery. Don't know if there's a feature I'm missing in the settings but what there should be is a feature that only turns on Wi-Fi when there is a known connection  not randomly turning it on and off as I walk down the street. Unchecked """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Remember new Wi-Fi's"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" but don't think that will help. Disabling for now  hopefully this app will be fixed.""""

Review 5: I like the theory about this app but it does not work great in practice for me I like that it can switch my WiFi off and switch my data on when I leave home. It does switch on my WiFi on automatically at times when I get home but not always. Also my phone is dual sim and I have noticed it does not recognize cell id with my secondary sim therefore it never switch on WiFi when I use my secondary sim on its own

Review 6: Does what it says but doesn't help Well as an IT director I tried this app on 4 different phones and it worked flawlessly on all. However over the 2 week test every user reported the battery dying much quicker than just leaving WiFi on 100% of the time so evidently the theory of WiFi off except when connected to a network saving battery is incorrect. Tested on galaxy s4 and s5 HTC one m8 and LG Flex

Review 7: Doesn't do what it's supposed to do It does indeed turn my Wi-Fi on at home  but it also turns it on at work  even though I set the app to disable that location. The problem is that I have to input a password at work to connect  and until I do I lose my internet connection through 4G- missing emails. I tried several times to disable that location but it will still turn on Wi-Fi at the office.

Review 8: Does not do what I need it to do It was under my impression that I can save a location at which the app would switch on my wifi and connect only in coherence to that location and router. but this is constantly turning my wifi on whenever it senses that there is a nearby connection... and when my mobile data is turned on  it actually uses more data than it would if the WiFi was off.

Review 9: Has a mind of its own It activates when I get home like it's supposed to but it continuously attempts to connect to my workplace WiFi even though I have turned it off about a hundred times. Doesn't matter if I manually turn off WiFi or tell the app to disable the connection. It still tries to reconnect every few minutes. This is seriously irritating. Uninstalling...

Review 10: Auto turn off? When a hotspot is turned off and there's no connection this app states: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Wifi on  near a network"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". So what's the point of that? I would've thought the app would switch off wifi as soon as there's no connection  not switch off when """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""leaving that place"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".""""",4378,Wi-Fi Matic is a free app for the Droid Turbo 2 and HTC One M8.

org.cprados.wificellmanager,Positive,"Review 1: This is by far one my most favorite apps. This is exactly what I was looking for. I was tired of manually enabling and disabling Wifi when I get home or near my favorite hot spots. This does everything for me automatically and saves battery charge in the process. Kudos to such a great app. Update: 8/10/2015. This works well as long as it is running. But it doesn't run all the time. I don't know why it stops running. When I happen to notice that it should have disabled Wifi and check if this app is running or not  that's when it starts. Before this app  I had to manually turn off and on the Wifi. Now with this  I have to manually run this app for it do its job. Ridiculous!

Review 2: On my Galaxy S7 it seems to work as described i used it on my S5 and never had a problem however i noticed that when i bought my new S7 i did the transfer using Samsung direct transfer and noticed that the app did not work correctly so i uninstalled and found the latest version on the play store and now it seems to work. i can only give it 4 stars because i have not had it on the new phone that long and it will need time to aquire my networks that i use. i have high hopes that it will work like the old one. i will update my review if i run into any issues or if i find that it works like the older version and bump it up to a *5* thank for the app

Review 3: Best app for automatic Wi-Fi management I just downloaded this app  so I'll update my rating once I've tested it further  but I did my fair share of research regarding apps to automatically shut my phone's Wi-Fi functionality off when I'm not home  and Wi-Fi Matic is by far the most straightforward and well-designed of them all. It does exactly what it was built for  and it does only that  no unnecessary fluff to be found. Hopefully having multiple commonly used access points won't throw it off; I guess only time will tell!

Review 4: Great app except one issue Awesome app but there is one issue... At my office  there is a wi-fi connection but i am not using it (because it is password protected)... So since i haven't connected to that wi fi network  it is not there in the app's 'Wi-Fi Networks Remembered' list... In spite of that  the app turns on my wi-fi and when i disconnect it  it turns it on again. P. S: I am giving it 5 stars because i wanna encourage the developer to do more good work but i genuinely hope that this one issue is resolved..

Review 5: Worked Great (Update) Been using for over year now and never any problems  turns Wi-Fi on and data off automatically like it's supposed to. Update!! No problems until now  new phone Droid Turdo 2 running lollipop 5.1.1 some of the time it works but have noticed it turning off WiFi and going back to mobile data allot so I have to keep checking and turn WiFi back on plus the set times to deactivate/activate don't work anymore... Was a great app so hopefully it gets fixed and will be great again... Thanks

Review 6: Love this app  put it on every new phone I buy! REALLY saves battery on any phone. If WiFi is on  the internal radio in your phone is constantly checking for a Wi-Fi signal. This takes power  and a lot of it. This app is smart and simple... it quickly learns your access points  home  work  coffee shop  etc. By using cell tower triangulation: meaning no GPS used. If you help it along learning your access points it it's quicker  but it will figure them out on it's own fairly quickly. Try it and see!

Review 7: Does what it says I was broke and lost my cell service. So I downloaded a voip app and used WiFi for calling. When out around town I'd connect to various hotspots and make calls. This app kept up with all the WiFi's for me and connected. Some I'd have to open a browser  etc. Yet it saved me a lot of hassles. Now I have cell again and I use it to connect to different WiFi's so I can save on my mobile data. Never a problem. Ran it on three devices including a tablet.

Review 8: A question... I would like to know how exactly the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Near a Wi-Fi"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" area (yellow area) is computed... If I have  for example  three cell towers near my wifi  do I need to detect each of them to toggle my Wi-Fi on  or do I have to detect only one of them ? In other words  is the yellow area the intersection of each cell area or the sum of all the cell areas ? Thank you very much for your help !""""

Review 9: Works great on Galaxy S6 For those reporting errors using an S6 the app. needs to be manually started on boot/reboot. Once started it works as advertised. If you experience any trouble please go to Settings  Application  Running and check that the app is indeed running. Many battery saving apps will close it. Make sure it is Ignored. I am running Android 5.0.2 rooted. An excellent time saver.

Review 10: It WAS great on my previous phone Edit: not working with my HTC One M8. Seems it will not remember any wifis.

Review 2: It's really clunky for me  hard to make selections when pressing and the keyboard entry is a little whacky too... Although it is FOSS (open source)  so I'm supporting their effort. It's really a nogo now but has great potential. I couldn't find a way to connect to CalDAV servers. I chose the sync from the bottom of the create page and still received the notification that it would be local only. I have CalDAV-Sync installed and that otherwise works with ownCloud. As far as material UI is concerned: I realty like it and if the buttons and such were more reactive (hardly usable] I would have rated higher. I'll keep a pulse on this but no development whatsoever over the last 30 days a/o 03 Dec 2017. Has potential  but don't recommend.

Review 3: Better than Free! This program works perfectly  it syncs with synology caldav server with Marten's caldav sync app  and is fully compatible with gnome evolution. It would be even better if there was another program that worked equally well with caldav/ical VJOURNAL entries then we could have full synchronization with contacts  tasks  and notes/memos/journals via carddav and caldav.

Review 4: EDIT 4/14/2016: The app has magically started working again. I'm bumping this up to three stars now as the app has """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""magically"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" started working again. I'll bump it up to four if it continues after 60 days. --------------- I LOVED it until it suddenly stopped syncing with iCloud... AND NO WARNING! For that reason alone  HORRIBLE UX!""""

Review 5: Major drawbacks Some of my lists have many entries. New items are arranged at the bottom. An intuitive approach would be the other way around. However: Try to add 3 new tasks to an existing list of 50  then arrange the new ones on top. No dark theme available. It is free and it seems to be the only app compatible with CalDAV tasks  so I gave 2 stars.

Review 6: Great app and works fine with icloud account This is my primary task management app and using it in conjunction with Smoothsync. Sync itself works as promised. Is it possible to add start dates for tasks  recurring tasks and multiple alarms? Will support development in best way possible...PS: Task completion swipe is finicky.. Could use an update.

Review 7: Rev.Dr.Timothy Lee Petrey McGregor I don't have a great memory to start with so this really helps me to plan things that I have to do & keep track of my important things while I still have them on my mind! As far as that kind of stuff goes this is a good choice to download. So thats my opinion of this app. -Thanks-& God Bless You all.

Review 8: Close to the best ToDo app  but... This app is close to being the best ToDo app I've ever seen. However  the app gets slim to none attention from the developer when the app could really use some updates. Especially updates which would add some basic but very needed functionality (e.g. creating local task lists)

Review 9: This is a great app. Simple to use. I recommend it to anyone who needs lists to follow like I do. Thanks Marten. Is there any way you can add the ability to export and import these lists? I have several lists that I do several times months apart but don't like them hanging around till I need them again.

Review 10: Really like it but... Any way of adding recurring tasks ? I do notice that recurring tasks on iOS get synched on this app and work as expected.

org.dsandler.apps.markers,Negative,"Review 1: Just one big fix! This app has so much potential! The idea is brilliant  and it works like a charm. There's just one huge issue: the marker size. I have absolutely no idea how the sizing works. There's no way of knowing which end you're working on  not to mention the fact that you can't tell whether it's getting larger or smaller. I most often wind up crashing only to realise that I'm at size 128 on the wrong end when I come back.If we could only put in the numbers numerically  this would be five-star in a heartbeat!

Review 2: It seems really good  but I just can't figure out how to zoom in. I need to zoom in to draw the details  but there's no option and I just can't do it  which makes this app suck for that sole reason. I don't have a tablet  so I don't have more room to draw.

Review 5: My first drawing app that I have used WELL  here comes the nostalgia. It was back in 2015 when I drew with this app  I was just starting out with it. Now that I look back the app isn't really that great as I had seen it before. 3 stars out of 5

Review 6: Pressure sensing not working on Nexus 6P :( Markers worked great on my Moto X 2014  but the pressure sensing doesn't seem to be recognized on my Nexus 6P. Maybe a bug with Marshmallow? Anyone else get it to work on the 6P?

org.dsandler.apps.markers,Positive,"Review 1: Thanks! I didn't expect much  yet I am overjoyed with how well this app works. My only request would be a current color tile with a color picker. Amazed how easy and simple it is. I love how you can create a background  then load an image with a transparency over it. I am using it for web design. Other apps are hard to use  loaded with features and filters that are useless or cost extra just to activate stuff. Most paid apps have a roadmap that dead ends  anyway. It's great to see something wonderful for free. Update... I created a bunch of textures as a backdrop for my logo. Both created in markers  but now  all of the sudden the program is clearing the screen when I load the logo over the texture. I would rather have it just loading on top  like it has been doing. Still love it! 5 stars all day.

Review 2: Very good could be better. Needs more colours. Would be perfect if you could pick colours by code. I would also like if you could chose the size of the canvas. There's a few pros: The pen pressure sensitivity is the best I've seen but there's a lot of blotted areas which isn't too big of a problem. I also really enjoy the fact that you can choose the size of the tool by number. The app seems pretty easy to use overall. As an artist of several years (I've done lots of digital art) I see that this app has potential

Review 3: Great clean simple drawing program It is a little bit buggy on the Tegra note 7 and appears to be sharing memory with other art apps. Perfectly understandable because this tablet uses a different stylus system. I applaud the developers efforts he would do well to try one of these little tablets because of the incredible speed. I would like to see the Play Store implementing some of Jaron Lanier's theories on micropayments so that we could reward Daniel for his efforts even though he's not soliciting any reward.

Review 4: Very simple yet powerful! What I like most is being +Simple +Really free (No ads) +No suspicious permissions required. It is my daughter's favourite drawing app. She loads her worksheets to it (on her Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1) and uses the SPen to write  draw  and color then save them. I've two suggestions that may make it better: 1- Replace the Load menu entry with a toolbar icon (the same way like Save). 2- Enable Palm Rejection for Samsung Galaxy Note when the SPen is detached.

Review 5: This is a pretty simple drawing app. The pressure sensitive controls work well and it's very easy for kids to use. Everything in the app is pretty easy for kids to figure out. There is a limited color palette and three levels of opacity just a click away. There are a few brush size options  each of which is oddly customizable. This customization is the weakest part of the app since the size is very difficult to set. This app is great for doodling and entertaining children.

Review 6: This app is amazing! By far one of the best ones out there. With little to no problems this app has become my favorite. I do have one request though. Can you please add two things. 1: can you please add in a rainbow wheel thing so I could have a larger variety of colors? That would be amazing. And 2: It sould be even better if you can add a feature where you click on the color and that becomes the color you use. If you could do that  I would love it  thanks!

Review 7: How I would describe this app: amazing  basic yet powerful  ad-free  great interface  full-featured and complete. The lines are really high-resolution without quantizing and also works great with S Pen. I was looking for simple drawing app and I love this. So  this is the one you want if you're looking for something simple  straight to the point and useful. Only thing I would change is add a color selection tool.

Review 8: Penless pressure sensitivity solved !!! Is a five but I'm being critical only because I love ur creation here...Would like to see better WOrk flow with tool options and full screen....and why can't I change the opacity of my chisel tip ....Would like to see a slider for opacity instead of 3...and an option for multi touch for moving and zooming as well...thanks for the wonderful app...

Review 9: Impressive While this app is very simple - 4 brush types  set color pallate  no layers  no redo - it does respond to pressure on devices without built-in pressure sensitivity as advertised. I haven't found anything like it elsewhere  even in paid apps. Definitely worth considering as at least a utility to use with other apps if you want to draw on a phone or tablet.

Review 10: Markers - good but could be even better Markers is a good media painting app but falls short on brush resizing. It's far too sensitive when trying to adjust the low and high end of t the spectrum. Perhaps the developer can add the ability to adjust via numerical point entry.

Severely lacking in functionality. Sadly  using Google works much better than this stand alone app.""""

Review 2: Great app. We use it every time  only... I was looking through Hunter and noticed that a lot of the spells are duplicated several times. This makes the spell list look overly long  and could turn some players off  or even raise hopes of spell choice. This looks to be caused because Hunter is listed multiple times in the spell headers for those cases. Please fix this soon.

Review 3: Super Handy Easier to carry than 100s of pounds of books. However your latest update has an error. Many of the spells known charts for Occult classes are wrong. They are listed with 4 1st and 2 2nd level spells at first level. You forgot 0 level spells and it throws off the whole chart.

Review 4: Good offline reference; slow to update A useful tool to have around as a backup in case the SRD sites go down  but too slow to update to use as a primary resource. Unchained and Occult have been on the official site for months and this app still doesn't have them.

Review 5: Shaman spell list Sat down to make a shaman and I am lost as to what spells a shaman can use. The list at the bottom not only shows orisons but also some spells that do not show up when you look up the shaman under spells section. Which one do I go by? Fix plz

Review 6: Minor inconveniences: when I rotate my phone it brings me to the top of the page. Pretty annoying. Also poison doesn't have a link associated with it so I can't bookmark it. HTC 3D Evo 4G Edit: all of these are fixed  this is a must-have for Pathfinder players

Review 7: Don't download waste of time Doesn't have items and looks amateur  like someone typed it up on notepad. Cluttered and monotone  unintuitive catrgories. I love pathfinder and pathfinder deserves a better representation than this.

Review 8: Won't update I've made over a gigabyte of room on my phone  yet the app won't update to version 1.6  and I don't know why. I'm very frustrated!

Review 9: Pirating There's no way that this is okay. Paizo charges at least 40bucks for each book. They would never allow this free app.

org.evilsoft.pathfinder.reference,Positive,"Review 1: Handy for Gms and players alike. Probably the best app for Pathfinder general use. With bookmarks for making quick sheets for spells  feats  and everything in between  it's great for those who can't afford $40 per rule book. Kept very up to date  it also gives quick access for rules as an alternative to thumbing through manuals or searching the SRD. I wish spells had more ways to be sorted through  but they are alphabetically listed for each class. If you want a better app for spells  the Pathfinder grimoire compliments this app very well

Review 2: Probably my favorite pathfinder reference source  finally recently updated. Since the recent and long awaited update to include unchained and occult hardcover information  and even with what little bugs there are  this app is absolutely my favorite pathfinder related app. Even with all softcover content understandably missing  I still use this to reference material far more often than bothering with the pfsrd for the stuff that it does have. It's especially nice that it's offline. I'd gladly pay for this app.

Review 3: Pathfinder easymode This app is a great quick reference tool for anything Pathfinder. Picked it up on recommendation from a friend and now my whole group uses it. I'll always love having the books themselves handy to peruse  but this app makes it very fast for not just the DM to review any rules  feats  monsters  etc. but also the players themselves  so when an action is in question we're not all stuck scrambling for the book to check a ruling. Great app for designing a dungeon or encounter too!

Review 4: The best. Would be even better if you could connect to the pathfinder character sheet app from Prometheus Apps. I'm new to tabletop gaming  and I wasn't sure if I would like it very much  so this reference was PERFECT for me to get started. You can bookmark pages  and even divide your bookmarks into lists for specific characters. Great for learning the ropes  and even just if you forget your books or something. I love it.

Review 5: Great app  but incomplete The app works great and has been invaluable as a tool away from and at the table. It searches easily for anything you need to find  and the information there us as it appears in the rules. Unfortunately the Occult books have not yet been added to the app. But it has all other information I have searched for. If the developer updates the app I will be sure to change my rating to 5 stars.

Review 6: Thi is hands down the best reference for pathfinder I could find ever  both online and in stores  I don't know how I could have done without it and I firmly suggest it to anyone interested in the game  suggestion: it has so much content it might be overwhelming as first lecture so I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction but more like a way to ampliate your knowledge of the game

Review 7: I really like this app  but it is still missing some things. Everything I need for my druid is on here  but I am playing an archetype of samurai in another game called sword saint  which is not available. Other than that  it is pretty nice. I like how you can tell it to not pull content from certain books  because when it comes to magic I prefer sticking to the core rulebook.

Review 8: Psionics I love the app very useful for nearly everything  but the addition of psionics info would be even more useful  my groups campaigns frequently involve psionics in some form or another. OR develop a psionics only app! So those player who don't need it or never use it  don't have to increase the storage size of this app. Cheers though. Keep up the good work.

Review 9: very thorough I've been using this for a while despite owning PDFs to most of the books. I mostly use this app for the bookmarking feature so I can easily call up skills and descriptions for my characters. I also like that I can filter what rule books are used. What would be awesome and make this a 5* app for me is the ability to sync bookmarks between devices.

Review 10: Excellent interface but not perfect There are a few small inaccuracies here and there  such as there being an investigator spell list that is different from the alchemist spell list despite the book saying that investigators just straight up use the alchemist list. But for such a huge array of different rules this app is by far the best SRD app I've tried.",4365,The app is a great quick reference tool for anything Pathfinder.

Please fix it so I can give 5 stars! --- Your response says this has been fixed  but I just updated and tried again and it still failed to save the images. Reproduction steps: Click the '...' on an entry  click the blank image  select an image from your phone  save  then close the app by opening the app picker and swiping it away. Open the app again and the image is back to default - no way to make it stick.

Review 2: Works somewhat  but crashes repeatedly when scanning some QR codes When the app works  it works great; very easy to setup and use two-factor authentication. However  it repeatedly crashes while scanning some QR codes  which means it utterly fails in those situations. Even more  crashes caused by outside inputs are worrisome  especially in security apps. Right now it's just a denial of service  but could you fix it before someone makes it worse?

Review 3: Doesn't support HOTP Doesn't work with otpauth:// URLs--a must. Manual HOTP entry appears broken as well. Import via camera shows the image upside down (Nexus 6  LMY48I). Camera import appears to succeed  but HOTP scans are still misinterpreted as TOTP. For reference  Yubico Authenticator works where FreeOTP fails and the ZXing scanner works correctly.

Review 4: Please introduce these features: 1. pin secure the app; 2. Backup and restore the tokens to dropbox or other cloud service. I lost a phone a couple of days ago  and I need to spend 45 minutes to reconfigure this app. Though the most worrying was the finder might have accessed to all the sites since this app isn't protected.

Review 5: Used to work great  but having just reinstalled it it's constantly crashing on startup. I can add keys and they work until I close the app  after that it just keeps crashing. 'NullPointerException on TokenLayout.bind line 79' - 'Token.getDigits() on a null object reference' Same thing with Android 4.4.2 and 6.0.1

Review 6: Works for some services  but when I add my google account the codes it generates are different from those generated by the Google Authenticator app  and do not actually work! I tried adding the account both using the QR code and entering the key manually - both ways give the same (incorrect) codes.

Review 7: No instructions? A bit confusing for a novice like me. Tips: """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""key"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""secret"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" means the same thing  top box is username or leave blank  second box put the name of the site  and the remaining options I just left as is.""""

Review 8: Seems to add new entry (QR code scan)  but doesn't actually save it. Next time you open app the entry is gone. Seems to happen randomly. This is *extremely* annoying and I'm now locked out from important accounts for 2nd time within few weeks....

Review 9: It really needs an export function. When I switch to a new for (or just want to wipe this one) I'm stuck locking myself out of my apps. It could also use a bit of a facelift  showing the codes on app start rather than requiring another tap.

org.fedorahosted.freeotp,Positive,"Review 1: Powerful  Open Source alternative. Unlike competing two-factor/two-step authentication applications out there  FreeOTP Authenticator is not only completely Open Source  but it is developed by one of the very biggest and most trusted names in the Open Source Community  Red Hat! FreeOTP Authenticator works well - except for the fact that codes are cut-off in portrait orientation (something rectified by a switch to landscape orientation) - and has no obvious bugs... Very highly recommended  as is two-factor/two-step authentication itself.

Review 2: Good app missing some things. 1) Pin protection or fingerprint authentication for extra protection so others cant just take my phone and view my codes. 2)The ability to backup and restore the QR codes/Tokens so If I lose my phone i will be able to retrieve my codes and login to my accounts. That would be possible by creating something like a vault  exporting the tokens in a encrypted file that requires password to unlock and the ability to sychronize the vault to diffrent clouds much like keepass works. Thanks.

Review 3: Works great Initially had Google Authenticator just because I needed to set up two-way authentication for RuneScape  and that was the authenticator that they recommended. Then I realized there were other apps (such as this one) that didn't require 3rd party apps to work properly and that weren't difficult to understand. This app is great so far and does just what I need it to do  but I only use it for scanning QR codes  so there's that. The other stuff looks too complicated  lol.

Review 4: Open Source Liked it better before internet access was required - it's a security app after all - now major scrutiny is required each release (or a firewall app  ugh) - sorry non rooted laymen users  you're just gonna have to trust the devs with your second step. (e. g. trust the home security guy with knowledge of where you keep your hidden key. Probably no big deal  but...)

Review 5: Best OTP App Since Google Authenticator will not open anymore without crashing since I installed Lollipop I had to look for an alternative. I wish I had found this sooner. Better interface and slightly better physical security (by needing to tap an account before the code appears) than Google Authenticator  hands down. This app is going to be my only from now one.

Review 6: All issues resolved. Strictly adheres to the 2FA security model by disallowing exports and syncing. Ideal for security experts and other professionals who need perfect security  occasionally at the cost of convenience. Of all the compliant apps  though  this seems to be the most user-friendly; it fixes several UI/UX issues present in Google Authenticator.

Review 7: Best Open Source OTP This is by far the best open source OTP app I've found. It's only downfall is that it lacks many of the features in the closed source apps such as backup/restore. However  2 factor auth is all about being in control of my accounts  so I'm willing to forgo some of these highly desirable features in favor of open source.

Review 8: Best but... This is the best TOTP app currently available on play store. Only 3 improvements needed. First is PIN protection for accessing app  second is encrypted storage of account secret keys and last is encrypted backup of secret key import/export option. Hope  respective developrs may read this comment. Waiting for it badly.

Review 9: Excellent 2FA solution Love having an open source app for my 2FA accounts. Works just fine  and enjoy having the option to change the list order and upload my own logos. However  I would like to have the codes always show (like Google's Authenticator)  and an option to back up the keys somehow  even as a plain text file.

Review 10: Hooray for open source!

As advertised  it does seamlessly connect with the calibre server on my local network. However  it (or maybe the install of FBReader Pro) removed the calibre server on a potentially external network  and I'm having trouble putting it back. I don't think it should have taken away a feature I had working. In other words  typing in the URL was a major pain  partly because it is not documented that the URL is different for FBReader than for a browser. It is now easy  if it's a URL on the local network. (You have to add /opds for FBReader). Typing the URL for a non-local network is still a major pain  if possible at all  and this plugin or some other part of the FBReader infrastructure is making me do it again twice.

Review 2: Confused I love FBR Reader  it has done everything required. I've upgraded to Premium  and now I'm encountering features that I'm unsure whether I need them or not. I don't know what Calibre is  or DjVu. I just want to read books with no fuss  preferably offline. I could do that better with FBR free. Still love the main App  though.

Uninstalling this app & trying something else...maybe just use Calibre to convert files to mobi & read them in my Kindle app. When I try to open a file on the PC  the search path defaults to a sub-directory of My Documents & I can't change that path even though I store this kind of content elsewhere on my computer (external drive). It's probably possible to do what I want with this app  but I have limited patience when the learning curve is this steep. It's easier to just move to another app than it is to waste my time with back-&-forth with the developers.

Though it is without doubt a good reader  it isn't very intuitive in my opinion  and has several annoyances: ▪Although FBReader can read .DOC files  there is no association  so FBReader is not suggested as an option to open them.▪Sometimes the sliding screen brightness adjustment works  sometimes not.▪If a directory is removed from """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Where to search for books""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  the files in that directory are not removed from the library  even after a rescan. I only managed to remove these by using Settings/Apps/Clear Data  and then setting up FBReader again from scratch.▪In the Network Library  why is it not possible to disable the 'FBReader®book network' in Manage Catalogues?""""

Review 3: OK  I guess  but missing stuff Not easy to organize your books. Tags  collections  etc.  can't be created unless you are editing a book. They don't have a scrolling menu so you have to remember and type them. Can't select """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Mark as Read"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for a book  only as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""unread""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  and books I have read tell me it's 85% done (can't do anything about it). Can't edit Info's for more than one book at once so when you upload a lot of books  like I did  you have to go one by one  or give up. Can't upload a whole directory file  only sub-files one by one. Not the easiest or nicest app to use either. Need to add other add-ons to have pdf  bookshelf views  etc. The app is draining a lot of energy. But the paper effect background is nice  so it's a point in their favor...""""

Review 4: pretty great  three problems. 1: the cover image of every book shows up twice in my phone's gallery  flooding it with images. wish the app would save them internally and hide them from the gallery. 2: forces its own formatting instead of allowing the book to decide. i have several books that switch between centered and aligned  but fbreader forces only allows one way. 3. there was an error in one of the books i loaded into fbreader  so i deleted it  pulled a fixed version onto my phone  and hit rescan. what's in my book list? the original non-fixed version. i deleted the book again  uninstalled fbreader  used a root-explorer to remove every trace of the app and book  re-installed  put the new book version in. and it STILL showed the old version. what gives?

Review 5: Change how the Reset Page popup is displayed it opens too easily. Why not just add it as a menu item? Can't see why anyone would be resetting and changing the page on a regular basis. Really annoying and not a real useful function anyway. ------ Stop the app from jumping forward 5  10 pages when you put the phone in your pocket. ------ Fix the navigation; click on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""By Author"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and select an author and it just displays the recently read books by that author. If on the other hand you open by """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""File Tree"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" it finds all the books by that author.""""

Review 6: Remove navigation bar!!! (+call to devs) It causes a lot of annoyance. Just make it an option in the menu and remove it from the default screen. I always go to other page unintentionally and go back to reading mode so i can't reset the page. I'll revert rating to 5 stars once it is addressed. Also  i really want to buy your premium version to thank you but i think the price is too steep for the added features are useless to me. If you can add the function like in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""GrabMyBooks"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" app  the i will buy the premium app.""""

Review 7: Simply awful. Tl;dr get PocketBook. FBreader is a sluggish reader. It requires a plugin to read pdf files  the documents list is awkward to use and doesn't remember the last location of the currently opened document. You have to navigate back to the folder if you are trying out a lot of ebooks. When zooming a page  navigating to the next page results in the view jumping to the portion that was previously outside the screen size.This is simply awful UX. A lot of functions have to be accessed by going into the menu.Quirky!

Review 8: Unstable Crashed within minutes of first use. Tablet's Screen brightness is overridden by the app. The app increases brightness to maximum for day and night reading. So  this will drain battery life rapidly  and reading at night will ruin my eyes. It looks like a good app otherwise  except for these very fatal flaws. Why doesn't android have a good stable eBook reader that does a good job with PDFs ?? I have tried a half dozen apps  and all at any price  have fatal flaws that render reading PDFs painful  unreliable.

Review 9: Doesn't support Marshmallow? I've been using fbreader for many years  on the Nokia N770 and Sharp Zaurus  maybe even on Windows CE. I'm sad to say that my time with fbreader may be at an end  at least until Marshmallow support is added. For both the internal memory and SD card  I get a permission denied error when attempting to access directories on them. Consequently  I can't open any books but the built-in help book. Looks like I'm off to find an alternative  hope that fbreader adds Marshmallow support soon!

Review 10: My fiance tried to get me to use this with my first Android phone  but I was too lazy. I finally put it on my first tablet  and was in love. It was le créme de le crème for several years. Unfortunately  that's no longer true. It can't find some folders - hence missing the books in them - which ruins the whole bloody point! It also tends to crash incessantly while reading PDFs  even with the needed add-on. Thoroughly annoying. I still recommend it for first-time users  but I'm looking for something new myself.",6748,"Reviews: ""Not the easiest or nicest app to use either.

org.geometerplus.zlibrary.ui.android,Positive,"Review 1: Best app on my phone.. Including phone itself. After trying 7-10 other e-book readers and finding multiple issues with each one  I stumbled across this one (thinking it looked so basic it was gonna be another crappy one) with nothing to lose...6 years and 7 phones later it remains my all time favorite  and most used app ever. I use it by far more often than any other app  including the phone dialer. Every new phone I've gotten this has always been the first app to go on  and flawless syncing with FB reader and Google drive means I just have to download and sign in on new phone and everything is right in the world again.. plus I can pick up any of my multiple devices and open to same spot no matter what device I stopped on.. Can't go on enough about how much i love this reader.. bought the premium version not because the free one was lacking.. Honestly if I never even open the premium version and kept using the free one it will be worth the price after the years of enjoyment from free one.. Really just buying it to thank developers. Couple of small changes might make it PERFECT (really I'm nit picking here) 1. Auto scroll would be awesome for people like me who need larger font so we don't need to turn page every 3 servings 2. Pinch to adjust font size (for same reason) 3. Bookmarking could be made easier with dedicated space in corner... And that's all I can think of that isn't perfect

Review 2: So far  best out of 7 apps I've tried First week on android and I've tried multiple apps to switch from iReader - FBReader is so far the best. I can organize my library on my SD card  add tags  edit book titles  control the screen brightness... awesome! One thing I am missing is to be able to add bookmarks quickly (e.g. quick tap on the top right corner) instead of going to menu  add bookmarks  add new bookmark. Just a tad annoying. Overall  I love this app so far and will be more than happy to get the full version  to support the team  but will give the free version a spin for another few weeks.

Review 3: Soooo many options! Highly recommend. Average amount of permissions  free & extensible! I love all the choices I'm given for appearance! Plus so extensible & supports a good amount of formats. Love that I can choose ANY fonts & formats I want for several different types  titles  footnotes  whatever else (& separately). #1 important feature in apps for me is color options  especially in an app like this  & this lets you choose colors for quite a few different areas! Connects to Calibre library server  too(W/ plugin)! Wish I'd known before buying Calibre Companion yesterday  cause this is free!

Review 4: Ergonomically flawed A great app  but the bookmarks are both too hard to reach and too laggy (it takes a few seconds for it to happen - should be instantly). Reaching - it used to be """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Menu button - Bookmarks - Add""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  now it's """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Touch anywhere - Top left corner - Bookmarks - Add"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". An extra step since the update has been added even though it was inconvenient already. Two actions max  ideally a single long press of Menu or Back for instant bookmark would be best. Hope I will be heard. Thanks for your spectacular work on this reader.""""

Review 5: I have been using this app both free and paid for well over two year and it has been great. The best feature is the TTS plug-in that makes all your e-books audio books as well  great while driving and such. However after this last update I find that the app crashes to a blank screen and must be closed and reopened to use. I also find that the TTS plug-in now skips sentences and will repeat sentences with enough frequency to be very annoying. I hope this will be resolve in the next update. Beyond this bump in the road I still feel this app offers the best options for an ebook reader.

Review 6: Getting better! Recent bookmark update gave a lot of what I asked the devs for! Leaving at 4/5 because it's almost there!: -Include separate """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""page number only"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" bookmarks  in addition to new """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""note style"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" highlights (most of the time I don't want highlights showing up in bookmarks) -List page# marks and notes in separate menus -Allow sorting of bookmarks (eg page#  date  etc) -Profiles for text size  margins  etc  for landscape and portrait mode so you dont have to adjust every single time you reorient your tablet""""

Review 7: I wanted to like this. But it seems to be missing some important features  such as: select a word (such as a name)  and show occurrences with some context  especially the first few  then return to current position; scroll page up and down so any arbitrary line is at the top (or bottom). I do like the sync and Google drive integration  and ability to add my own Calibre library. But all in all  I still can't seem to be able to leave Moonreader+; in spite of it shortcomings  it's still way ahead. I'll keep looking and hoping something will improve.

Review 8: This is the app for the ebook veteran This is the ideal ebook reading app for android if you have been into ebooks for a long time and have mobipocket  txt  rtf and epub format ebooks that are not protected by drm. In general over the years I've gotten .txt and mobipocket ebooks that I imported to my android smartphone when I bought it. It works great. Has animation  day/night mode  3 fonts  tons of sizes and the option to search ebooks by filetree in your device. Works like a charm. UPDATE 01/04/2016. Now syncs across devices via Drive 6stars!

Review 9: The best epub reader now with sync across devices and Calibre plug-in I've used FBReader for a few years and it has got better and better. It was already very neat app with good options for fonts  backlight  page turning  online stores and so on. Recently it gained Google Drive integration so you can keep your books synced across Android devices  and there is also available a Calibre plug-in so you can download from your desktop/laptop based Calibre library. FBReader now makes for a very good replacement for Amazon's Kindle app.

Review 10: It's really a nice app for book lovers  no doubt it's OPD catalogs providing good books having great literary value but predominantly these books are pre 21 century  addition of books of 21 century will make FB reader More awesom & fascinating one for new generation  please add a catalog having post 2000 published books by popular authors such as Sharon draper  Suzanne Collins  Khaled Hosseini  Jeffrey Eugenides  Ian McEwan & others  I hope so that developers & managers will consider my suggestions......",6636,The app is free and extensible.

org.helllabs.android.xmp,Negative,"Review 1: Really good player This one plays my mod files flawlessly. The only cons i have found are inconsistencies with the interface (e.g. i found no way to access the current playlist if i have paused for a while and return to the app)  it does not remember my shuffle settings  and maybe the worst is huge cpu cinsumption. My phone has burnt over 20% of its battery in around half an hour for something that should be cheaper to do :). Running on SM-N900

Review 2: It probably is a good player But I can't get to the files where are my .mod :( its in the download folder I've tried so much change how the directory works... Like how Amiga mod guru does it yes infact I'm using that

Review 3: The best module player. Period Edit: Not sure why but DSPs do not work with XMP. I thought it was a sampling rate issue  but my DSP incorrectly states the sampling rate  so it's most likely something else.

Review 4: File Browser Can't use it. Would be nice if the file browser actually allowed you to navigate to the files  rather than Han having to manually type a path each time.

Review 5: Permissions? Why does this music-playing application need access to 'read phone status and identity'?

org.helllabs.android.xmp,Positive,"Review 1: Fantastic app. Plays a very wide range of formats  and the interface is far ahead of the other similar players out there. There is really only one thing which is lacking: headset controller integration. It would be wonderful to be able to pause using the headset button  or jump forward or back in the playlist. But  even lacking that  I prefer it over the alternatives. It is that good. Edit: Thanks Claudio for asking about that. I should have been more specific above. I have not had trouble with any of the various bluetooth controllers I have used  but the conventional wired variety unfortunately do not work. I still use these often because I run down the batteries on the wireless ones. Not a big deal surely  but I note it as the only thing which wasn't perfect. A really fantastic app.

Review 2: Fantastic Chiptune Player I've tried many chip tune players for android and while some of them support one or two formats that Xmp does not  they pale in comparison. Xmp's channel view is particularly awesome; you can see the currently playing waveform for each channel and each can be singled out or muted individually (surprisingly uncommon among android chip players). The instrument names are displayed front and centre (great for those chipper's notes). The developer is great too; very responsive and accommodating. Simply fantastic

Review 3: A great trip down memory lane I only wish it supported even more old school formats (Amiga custom  SID  SAP...) but that's probably not the goal of this app and it already has the most important ones. The search on Mod Archive didn't work so well until I realized you could/should use wildcards: it might be worth mentioning it somewhere. Also  their database is sometimes incomplete/incorrect (specially regarding composers). Proposing alternative sites might help (AMP; any other?). Anyway  keep up with the great work!

Review 4: Best in class! I've been using this app from the start and it's gotten better and better with every update! At first I dismissed the modarchive search and download since it didn't work  but recently I found out the problem was with the location I set for my mod directory and now it works! It would be nice to have access to the genre filters to make it more useful. Of course  every time there's an update I always check if a couple of my problematic mods got fixed  but now I think I will send these in myself.

Review 5: Pretty Great Love that it has the track view. Wish there was a way to go into a playlist  turn on shuffle  select a song to play  and have it shuffle play after that song is over. Instead  it'll just play the next song in the playlist. The only way to get shuffle to work is by going into a playlist  turning on shuffle  and hitting the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""play"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" button  so it starts with a random song. There's no way to pick a song I specifically want to hear  and have it shuffle after that.""""

Review 6: The best I've found for Android  but... It's the most compatible and accurate module player I've tried for Android  and the linear resampling is really clean and maintains the brightness. But I've also encountered some bugs in the playback engine. Some tempo changes aren't right  some notes play out of tone  the retrigger command (E9x on XM/MOD  don't remember the S3M/IT code) doesn't work  and sometimes you can hear detuned notes that shouldn't be audible. Otherwise  keep up the good work.

Review 7: Works """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""almost"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as good as previous version Looks like my early review was a bit premature  but some files are making this application crash  but not all of them. :-) Hopefully you will see my crash reports as I send them in.

Review 8: Brilliant app I love being able to listen to all my old amiga game music. Only 3 small items short of perfection. 1 would be nice if it could remember the folder you were last in on next load. 2 for some reason it doesnt seem to support pattern breaks (at least on soundtracker mods) 3 an oscilloscope would be an amazing feature  i used to love watching the oscilloscope display on the amiga trackers!

Review 9: Well designed and functional mod player Beautifully designed mod player however I have rated it with 4 stars as there are a few popular songs in exotic Amiga formats (TFMX  David Whittaker  Hippel) which are not yet supported and are tricky to support that would place this app into the premier league. Thanks to the author for listening to my feedback  quick response and regular updates.

Review 10: Best MOD player on Android! On Windows  I use XMPlay to play MOD files  and I love the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Pattern display"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature it provided. I've tried many MOD players on Android  and this one is the only one that provides the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""pattern display"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature.

org.iilab.pb,Negative,"Review 1: Still needs improvement Great concept. I tested to see how it would work and so those on my notifications would know what they were receiving  it crashed several times trying to turn it off. I'm also noticing a significant battery drain since install  it's no use if it's bleeding my battery and the phone is near dead when I really need it

Review 2: Xperia Z The on/off button has other 3 purposes  so adding a 4th panic button function is no good.. I may suggest under the air a proposition  may be it will solve the crucial problem.

If you do  you lose what you have done  and start over. Why Developer? Why? If you hit the wrong button  why can't you go back? Ex.: Archive - You can't undo it  or restore it. Schedule - If you hit weekly you are stuck there. What us the point of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""SAVE"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" if the app won't let you change once you've hit a button. And """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""DISCARD"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" makes you start over. SAVE or DISCARD. Yuck! Poor design.""""

Review 2: Good  but I have recently discovered that the 'Best Steak' is misleading  since the App adds days shown in a transparent way in the 'History' section (why?) which alters the 'Best Streak' section. So  instead of i.e. 2 days that have actually been accomplished it shows  say  12. I didn't have this before  it only appeared recently. What I mean can be seen in your 4th. screenshot above. Quite annoying. If this wont be fixed I will be uninstalling. Other than that  very good app.

Review 3: Main functionality doesn't work for me. I have a Moto Z Force Android 7.0. The pop up reminders that allow you to check a task does not work. I get the pop up but I will use the checks on the notifications for a week but none of them registered. When I opened up my app nothing at all was recorded. Obviously it makes it pointless. I'll have to get another app. Yes I know that I can open the app and do it myself but I simply would rather use the pop ups.

Review 4: Dear developers-I just installed the app.i have treated the habits list.why isn't the remainder remainding me.though I have set the timings properly.i never got a remainder.is it that I should make a point of remembering and then going and ticking in the app.If only I could remember what want to at any point of time why would I go for an app like this called habit tracker.as I'm feeling difficult to develop new habit I wanted this.pls help me out.

Review 5: Nice design but probs with alarms I like this but the reminder settings can't be changed easily. I set up some habits and added reminders. Then changed the the reminder times for some items and turned some reminders off. Nope. Didn't work. Keeps sending reminders based on the first settings I put in. Pain in the neck. Looks like I'm going to have to reinstall and 're-input everything just to change the reminders. Might not be worth it.

Review 6: Great app but """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Loop Habit tracker"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" looks kinda clunky when installed... too much text. Would be sweet if it just said """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""habits"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Quite a few apps I have will shorten the text when installed... edit: SERIOUSLY? it even shortens the title to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""habits"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in my application manager  why can't it do that in my app drawer?? Cmon guys..""""

Review 7: Not as great as Habit Bull I haven't been able to set up a habit for doing something 14 times a day once every hour with hourly reminders. The same thing was easy to set up in Habit Bull. I don't know why the reviewers here compare this app so favourably to Habit Bull when it so much lacks in functionality. Maybe because it's so basic it's easy to use unless I'm missing something.

Review 8: Why is there no Google account sign in and backup automatically. I had to reinstall the up because I got a new phone and I lost all my data. If this is a tracking service then they should make reclaiming data and saving that data very easy especially with automatic sign on with Google. I don't see why this feature was missed otherwise this would have been a 5-star rating

Review 9: I really like the concept and design of this app  but the actual implantation is broken. Often my check marks do not appear in the app. It may have to do with most checks I put in are done on notifications on my android watch. Either way I can't trust this app unless that is fixed. It seems internally it does have the right information  it just doesn't show it.

Review 10: Love it but there's one major fault that makes it hard to use it. If I set one habit to be 2 times every week  then if I do it on Monday and Tuesday one week  I can't do it on Thursday next week  I have to do it on Monday again..

I love the simplicity of it and the ability to be able to see everything 'at a glance' on the opening screen. It makes it exactly what I was looking for. It's almost like a super simple """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""to do"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" list but I really love that it doesn't force reminders on me. I like that the frequency of the tasks is really easy to customise. My only suggestion for improvement would be to have more colour options available  but that's a very minor thing. Otherwise it's brilliant  I use it every day.""""

Review 4: I found this app only last night and so far so good. I really  really like it. I use a paper planner for my everyday purposes. Arthritis in my hands is beginning to make writing all the time a difficult and painful process. As much as I like to write  the prospect of not being able to as I get older is frightening to me. So I think I may decide to try digital planning (again!) but this time with apps that closely resemble my paper planner inserts. I hit the jackpot with this one! This tracker is amazing and it's nearly identical to what I've used on paper for years. It's making my transition from paper to digital planning very easy. Good job!!

Review 5: Nice app but need a lot of improvement Nice routine checker system.. But need a lot off improvement.. Plz plz improve the notifications system..add vibration..and make notifications sound louder.. Improve the day to day habit adding system.. I do different thing every other day.. I would really like a a week 7days routine system..the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""time tunes app"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" has nice routine adding system..you guys should cheak that..plz improve yor widgets they are awful.. I recommend it to be like """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""roubit app"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""".. Plz cheak that.. Hope this does better.. Thanks""""

Review 6: EDIT: The last update fulfilled my request. Now you get little circles next to your habits that are filled in based on how strong each habit is. I also welcome the new features of having the habit reminder and frequency settings displayed at the top. And also night mode. I really appreciate that the app is completely free without any ads. It's making me more aware of my habits. Simple and intuitive to use. The one improvement I could suggest is adding in a widget or graph that compares all my habits so I could see at a glance which habits are strong and which ones need improvement.

Review 7: Helping to Change My Life for The Better! I was looking for something that would help me with maintaining consistency. I do a great job of starting  but it has always been sticking with the plan that has been the hard part. This app is awesome  it is the first time that I have been able to see a visual representation of what I either """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""have"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""have not"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" been doing. I no longer have to guess about my personal """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""to do's""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  I can now easily track them every day! Thanks Alison!!""""

Review 8: Almost perfect :) The app is really awesome  has a beautiful design  many features and I can truly recommend to anyone I know. I used many habit tracker apps so I just have a few suggestions of little features to the badass who develop this app : 1. An extra option/buttons to select a custom color for the habit  2. A little less transparency in the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""check in"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" widget. Sometimes it's really hard to read what's written in the widget and 3. Option to select which days of the week the habit will be done. All the rest is OK.""""

Review 9: Amazing application  worth for everyone who wants to live a well defined life and promote themselves up. Loved every bit of it. A little suggestion as a feature request which I felt was missing. When you ask for a reminder and a question for the habit  on the same screen  you can also add a field that asks time for the remainder  like at the starting of the day it will remind me that so and so habits are to be fulfilled today and at defined time(which is currently present) it will ask for question whether you have been successful today with it.

Review 10: Great! This app is really good and extremely simple (in a good way) for planning and maintaining new habits and has great graphics to follow your evolution. To be complete  could add a function to not only check the days  but mark it as """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""completed""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""failed"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""skip"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" (you will not break the streak but it will not be improved  either) (e.g. in the case of a holiday); as well as the option to select the days of the week you want to perform that habit).""""",6550,Reviews of 'org.isoron.uhabits' by users around the world.

This is a good game to help wind down for a few minutes after a stressful day  or just for fun anytime.

Review 2: Excellent port. The game is better to play now on Android  than it was on a Linux PC. The game has many options to control gameplay. The three control modes are really welcome. In the past  it irritated me somewhat to use the keyboard. Now  the point-to-shoot control is so easy and intuitive. It's really great that people are porting Linux stuff to Android.

org.kde.kdeconnect_tp,Positive,"Review 1: This is probably the most useful Linux app I've seen in a while. Sharing clipboard and notifications  having the ability to ring my phone  the application of my phone's touchscreen as a trackpad... It's great! Although  a few things I feel should be added as optional plugins  namely an SSH connection or VNC integration  or the ability to access your computer's file system from a phone. Besides that  KDE Connect is an amazing app  and is really easy to use. If you've got KDE  get this app!

Review 2: Excellent  does not need wifi on desktop machine. An excellent program  many thanks to Albert and any others who have worked on it. Music was playing on my desktop. I rang a number on my phone and my desktop music stopped for the duration of the call and then carried on afterwards  how cool is that? If you are running a firewall you need to open the range 1714 – 1764 in both TCP and UDP. otherwise it won't find anything to pair with. Working with Nexus 6

Review 3: Impressive Sometimes it helps me to forget about my mobile. It doesn't matter where I leave my phone at the same network  I can receive all the notifications on my desktop directly. When I listen to the music  it makes my acoustic system calm so I can hear incoming call. If you find something doesn't work properly  check your KDE applet  and tune it. OpenSUSE 13.2 and Moto G/X Play. Thanks to developers. No lags  no problems at all.

Review 4: Keeps getting better and better I have S5 Android 4.4 and this app works on my Ubuntu 16.04 Transferring files are very easy and 100 times faster then Bluetooth 4.0. Transfer files from and to mobile phone. I use the clipboard copy feature heavily. I use it on my workstation  desktop and laptop and so far no crashes or failures. Good job KDE I am very satisfied. I am so proud of this app. Thanks for the repo ppa developer.

Review 5: This app saves me so much time  doing day to day tasks. Being able to see what notifications come through my phone saves me time  the synced clipboard makes sending links to my friends 10x easier. Nothing like this exists on Windows for free  and that really says something about how dedicated KDE's developers are on making a truly innovative desktop environment. Keep up the good work  I'll be donating soon!

Review 6: works pretty well for free. for some reason i get double notifications for messages (telegram). also  i cannot browse device files and folders from my laptop. besides that i use it to check battery status  send files to and from  and receive my phone's notifications on my laptop. cant wait to see more development and will be donating once they fix my small issues or do a lil something else to impress me.

Review 7: Just what I've been looking for! Despite some minor issues on the desktop (as I'm running Unity and not KDE/Plasma) this app works great! Notifications from the phone appear on my desktop as toasts  so I don't have to reach for the phone whenever it chimes. And the ability to share anything (links  pictures  videos  ...) having it instantly pop up on my desktop has saved me a lot of time!

Review 8: Works great when it's connected  but my phone seems to drop the connection after entering sleep mode  and I can't figure out why. Also  wish you could browse your computer's file system from your phone  or access your music library through Amarok  or even stream video and audio to your Android device. 4-stars because it's a solid app  but it needs a few more features to earn a 5th.

Review 9: Work fine  but not explored whole file-system of the sdcard  only pictures from camera. Phone side setting not allow to change destination folder of the received files from laptop (setting not work yet  it just deactivated). As new future it will be great if will be visible phone screen and customer can control phone device from laptop. Thanks for this great application! :)

org.kiwix.kiwixmobile,Negative,"Review 1: This app used to work great  and was invaluable to me on many overseas trips where internet access was spotty  but the recent version is not working for me (hence the 3 stars for an otherwise 5 star product). I have a 128GB external card  and of course a smaller amount of internal storage. I go to settings and change the storage to the external SD Card (it shows I have 33GB available on that card). When I try to open a local file (clicking the SD icon and going to the local tab)  Kiwix just scans and scans and scans without finding anything. It displays """"""""""""""""Scanning for ZIM files  please wait..."""""""""""""""" and shows the wait spinner forever. Moving the ZIM files to the Kiwix folder doesn't help either. The older version was able find the ZIM files within 2-3 seconds  on the same SD Card and the same phone  using the same ROM. Please fix this. I have a month-long trip coming up to some underdeveloped areas and will be needing to read offline Wikipedia and wikivoyage ZIM files!""""

Review 2: The entire functionality of the Kiwix app relies on the ability to load external files (in .zim format) that you download separately. As such  you would think that the app would give you the ability to select a .zim file to load  but the app completely lacks any file selection dialog. I've downloaded multiple .zim files to try  but I can't select any of them in the app  so the app is essentially functionless. EDIT: Your response that you're surprised that search failed  and the solution to is to search again  complete ignores the actual problem. I don't NEED to search at all. I know where the file is. Why does the app completely lack the functionality to SELECT A FILE?!

Review 3: There is a serious problem with the Arabic Wikipedia: when I choose a blue word and press on  I cannot always get to the chosen page. I have to check on the page everywhere to find the page corresponding on the chosen word... anyway  thank you! Here is an example  I am using your last Kiwix  Wekipedia offline with Wekipedia of July 2016. Anyway  when I search for Algeria (الجزائر)  for example  the I want to choose """"""""""""""""Algerian flag (علم الجزائر)""""""""""""""""  It does not work; I need to press everywhere to find the the page corresponding on the chosen word """"""""""""""""علم الجزائر""""""""""""""""""""

Review 5: Good app *** TTS problems in update *** Kiwix is the best but I am having problems with the new update that includes a floating TTS control panel. The trouble is the panel does not work properly. After Read Aloud is selected in menu the TTS starts (as in older versions). Then a nice new control panel with Pause/Stop appears at the bottom of the screen. Pause does not Pause and Stop does not Stop TTS. Also  no Stop TTS in menu either - so unable to turn off TTS at all. Am running Android 4.1.2. Uninstalled Kiwix & old version .apk now installed.

Review 6: Poorly written articles  factual errors. I downloaded the simple version and was disappointed to find that most of the articles were written from a Christian rather than scientific point of view  often blatantly excluding fact. The articles were poorly written  which makes it seem like they were some sort of religious high school project. I had hoped to download the full version to see if it contained different articles  but the links appear to be broken  at least from my Nexus 6P.

Review 7: Its very smooth running but I am not able to add multiple files(Wikipedia and Wiktionary) simultaneously. At one time only one opens and not able to add other in other tab so as to switch easily between tabs. To use either I have to first select that file and load. Please make possible to add and and load multiple files hence providing option to switch between tabs. Edit: It still cannot handle more than one file at a time. You replied you will fix it by end of 2016. Please fix it.

Review 8: Gets the job done 64 Gb card is necessary for full download of Wikipedia. If you download via http  you will also likely have to change your browser's default download location to the SD card  which is WAY harder to do than it should be. On galaxy note 2 I had to use the default Samsung internet browser  because Firefox and Chrome don't even give the user control over download location  for ease-of-use cloudy-cloud-cloud mobile platform reasons I guess.

But when I hit the search icon  I usually end up clicking the star icon because suddenly it is now occupying the previous search icon position.

But when I hit the search icon  I usually end up clicking the star icon because suddenly it is now occupying the previous search icon position.",5832,Kiwix app was invaluable to me on many overseas trips where internet access was spotty. Recent version is not working for me (hence the 3 stars for an otherwise 5 star product) The entire functionality of the app relies on the ability to load external files (in .zim format) that you download separately.
org.kiwix.kiwixmobile,Positive,"Review 1: I have a love-hate-love relationship with this app. It has no serious competitors for reading Wikipedia offline on Android  and the interface is slick and pretty when it's working (and the OSX version is spectacular). But I dread every update  or moving to a new phone  because there's a large chance the app breaks. In the new version  the app was unable to find a long-used ZIM file on my SD card (yes  I switched to external storage in settings) and was just """"""""""""""""searching..."""""""""""""""" endlessly. I had to re-download the entire WIkipedia again *twice* before it was able to find the new ZIM file correctly and load it without crashing. I am grateful for this free app  and I know it's maintained and developed by perhaps only one person. But I would prefer more emphasis on robustness (and would be happy to support that financially!).""""

Review 2: Disappointing. It's a great idea in theory (worthy of 5 stars); wonderful if it actually worked for me. Over the years I've tried Kiwix on three different phones and one tablet  and am sad to say I've never been able to run anything more than the demo. The larger databases always crap out somewhere in mid download  or fail to open  or suddenly go missing just before they finish  which is particularly annoying after waiting a couple of days for the download to complete. As I said  I would love to have this app if I could get it to work on any of my devices. And I should also say that I sincerely appreciate the work you've done; it's a terrific project. Maybe some day I'll get it to function for me...

Review 3: Full offline WIkipedia! Thanks to Kiwix  I now have wikipedia_en_all_2016-05  wikipedia_en_all_nopic_2016-05  wikivoyage_en_all_2016-08  and wiktionary_en_all_2016-08 on my phone. I transferred these from my Mac using Android File Transfer. For Wikipedia  note that it is recommended to download the bundled kiwix-0.9+wikipedia_en_all_2016-05 and kiwix-0.9+wikipedia_en_all_nopic_2016-05 versions as only these bundled versions have large zim files pre-split for storage on the external card on the phone. I no longer need to manually use the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""split -b 4000m"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" command. Kiwix is not perfect  but I strongly value this project.""""

Review 4: All of human knowledge in my pocket. We truly are living in the future. For the full English Wikipedia  you need a 64GB SD card (nearly full). To include the index you need something a bit larger (next one up is 128 GB). The interface isn't quite as good a Firefox  but it's pretty good - and much faster even on a fast network. On my 720x1280 screen  there's a common glitch where the first few words of an article appear next to a photo or summary box and then there's a long gap down to the rest of the text. This seems less common than in previous versions.

Review 5: Close to perfect Very practical and fast to use  even on my """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""tankphone"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". What's most appreciated is the ability to load Wikivoyage files from the SD card after installing  one thing the official """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Wikivoyage offline"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" app doesn't allow (won't even install on my phone due to its size). What to improve? *Add the possibility to edit the online version right from the app *Switch from one language to another on the same article *Keep only one item of each article searched in the history. Thumbs up!""""

Review 6: Very good overall Ability to look up Wikipedia even without Internet connection (and connection costs .. and delays) is often invaluable. The application is very good overall  although there is still some room for improvement: Search function is a bit strict regarding to case and diacritics: You get much more warships with 'HMS ..' and 'USS ..' than with 'hms ..' and 'uss ..'  and if you are not used to diacritics you can look up Rohanese 'Lord of the Rings' heroes only indirectly ..

Review 7: Best and only zim reader Its amazing to access the whole wikipedia without any data connection  even in flight mode  free  no bags and without adds. Some are rating this low  not because the app is bad  but they don't know how to use it. I would ask them to read the FAQ  before publishing unfair remarks. One suggestion. The links of contents that come after swiping from right should take us to the exact location in the content (not working that way at the moment).

Review 8: Good Location to internal sd card  /storage/sdcard0/Android. I'm not so sure  currently am trying to download the 16 g wiki to my insd but it shows internal storage insufficient  am running lolipop 5.1 with storage options   let the system decide  internal and external but even if choose external it shows same note  maybe my phone can't set downloading location. Anyway thank you for this brilliant idea  hope in future it can update curren zim

Review 9: First off  thank you for all you awesome people at Kiwix have done is making the world a better place by not only making but also bringing the future to humanity. Although as a little proposition  it would be even more awesome if there's a color pallette option for the night reader mode to make it even easier on the eyes. All in all  this is one of the best and one of my favourite in every aspect of it. Thank you again for being awesome!

Review 10: Really fantastic app  great amount of content  nice and simple interface  quick and easy-to-use  and about 70% accessible to the visually impaired. Features are fairly good  mostly effective and don't clutter the interface. I intend on updating this review as per the next version due April  for I'm hoping for the option to view article in web-browser.

Review 2: Nice nmap frontend  but if you're expecting something that presents data like Zenmap  this isn't it. It's still acceptable for manually looking at the nmap results  though.

org.libreoffice.impressremote,Positive,"Review 1: I used to carry extra long VGA and USB cables so that I could position my laptop on a rostrum and to one side of a presentation. No longer so! Thank you Impress Remote. I recommend just using a hand held lasar pointer and don't give up on Bluetooth connection problems - it does work! My own problems with Bluetooth are due to a poor laptop and not this App. For large auditoriums or where the Bluetooth range is poor  definitely set up a WiFi connection. Now my laptop can be wired and left close to the data projector  and I just stand nearby  tablet in hand. Much better for audience attention as I can move about. Highly recommended. Improvements? Better resolution for the notes on handheld devices would be nice  but not essential. For some reason hidden slides in a presentation are shown by this App  the workaround is easy - save and use an abridged presentation.

Review 2: Thanks  appreciate it This worked well for me on linux wifi. However one quibble about the UI. I would like to see the timer displayed in detail at all times and remove the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""NOTES"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" heading. I know they are my notes  you don't have to tell me and I want the screen space. I would also love functionality where I could set times starting a specific slide.

Review 3: Excellent! Quick  smooth and easy - it's hard to fault. It would be nice to have a built in pointer and a constantly visible preview slide  and it would help if the pane view started from or at least included the current slide  but it's still an outstanding app.It's got a pointer now!

Review 4: It works! For this kind of so simple app  the most important thing is that it works out of the box! And yes  this is the case. Anyway there is always room of improvement... I.e. Instead to use buttons implement gestures to control the presentation...

Review 5: It works amazingly! I have used LibreOffice Impress Remote at least on one professional occasion: It helped me deliver a smooth presentation! I would've never guessed my HUAWEI Honor smartphone could become a darling slide-show remote control...

Review 6: Neat stuff! Feature Request. Love the app. It's simple and smooth. I liked the fact that there is a pointer feature as well. What I would like to see is the ability to add annotations. 5 stars if that happens :-)

org.ligi.fast,Positive,"Review 1: This app is so good it makes too much sense for it to be a stock android app. That would make things too easy. I am a die hard Android fan  but we all know Android tends to make things as multistep as possible in order to avoid user frustration and increase security. I opened this app  did exactly one search and after the app immediately opened since I apparently only had one that started with swiftly  I immediately came here to rate this app. One of the problems I have with next launcher is that the search function requires you to click inside the searchbox  which is at the very top of the screen  making this an inconvenient and inefficient task on my note 5. This app already has the cursor ready to go so you can just type. I immediately knew this is one of the best apps I have ever installed and I have purchased and downloaded many good apps. This app makes it less exhausting to have an android phone. I would die before owning an iphone  but since I like having a clean homescreen and I like to be able to access any app from any screen  I am regularly using shortcut and gesture apps  which is a lot to remember in itself  so having an app that just cuts out two steps improves the entire user experience of my phone.

Review 2: This is easily the best app search tool I have found. Admittedly  all it really does is take the Search Apps textbox and repackages it into a simple icon and adds some features  but that is very handy. It offers a simple user experience. It displays and searches through all the apps on your device. It can be set to launch apps automatically. And it closes automatically once you've opened an app (i.e. it doesn't continue to run in the background). There is no lag  and there are no ads. This is as close to using a folderless system for apps as you can get. And I almost forgot to mention  it's very FAST.

Review 3: Excellent Search filter by Package name in addition to the Label name. Finds the characters anywhere in the name. (Uncheck the option SearchWithinWords  which highlights -Individual- letters.) ―― Good options overall. Fair display options  needs FontSize. ―― [ The closest to a simple app -List- is using: IconSize=Large  & OnlyShowAppNames  & LinesOfText=3 ] ―― The sibling apps FAST & FASTER are equal in function  you can save the most space with either by using the smallest 'Icon Resolution' setting of 48.

org.ligi.vaporizercontrol,Positive,"Review 1: ALMOST perfect I use this app with the Crafty vaporizer device instead of the the official app made by s&h. PROS: I prefer this app because I find it to be simpler and more straight forward to use  it has all the same important features. It also gives the exact battery level (0%-100%) instead of the less exact official app which gives battery level in 20% increments. CONS: the only thing that I think must be added to this app are the vibration function controls and sound functions for the connected smartphone device.

Review 2: Better than the Volcano app! I like the way this app automatically searches for my crafty and finds it without having to enter the serial number. I also like the digital brightness display and the digital battery meter that the original app lack. This app does not have ability to control the charging indicator or vibration but seems to do everything else. Wish it could be used to extend the auto shut off time!

Review 3: Thank you for the reliable alternative! The only suggestion I have is that after changing the unit of measurement  the temperature selection is still in Celsius when you hover over the bar (not a big deal). There also didn't seem to be a way to turn off the Crafty's vibration feature through this app. Otherwise  this is a lot more responsive and reliable than the official app. Thanks!

Review 4: Great app! Good work buddy. Nice  simple  clean. Perfect. Works great on my HTC ONE M8  however is not compatible in my CaFi Car Android unit  but no stress. Keep it up. 5 Stars.

Review 5: Fastest! Decimals upgrade! Landscape added! Great app. Add vibrate (I still keep the old app to use this option)  color backgrounds  easier way to control temp.

So NOW this APP is RESPECTING USER'S PRIVACY & other RIGHTS (comparatively more  than similar apps). So we r now increasing review Stars. As its improved & its a less-bloated & privacy-respecting app.

Review 6: Great! Does everything I needed it for. I am very happy. I am using Linphone in combination with one of my VoIP-accounts and its flatrate on my phone together with an Internet flat  but no phone flat. It has - what I expected and what's usual - about 1/2 sec delay but I can live with that. I can call others without major problems (see delay) and inbound calls reach me  too.

Review 7: I am using this app with a VoipBuster account. I find it a lot better than VoipBuster's own app! This app runs as a service meaning that incoming calls can be received at any time. There are some aspects that can be improved though! At this moment dialing a number from android's contact list is not working!

Review 8: I tried using this app with a VoipBuster account. I found it a lot better than VoipBuster's own app! This app runs as a service meaning that incoming calls can be received at any time. There are some aspects that can be improved though! Better apps exist if one is willing to pay a little more!

Review 10: Works amazingly well on my samsung note 5 running android 6.0 marshmallow. Best of all the sip apps I've tried.

org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Negative,"Review 1: Great when it works  but very inconsistent None of the toggles work consistently. The main on/off toggle never seems to do anything. I've had night mode working and not working with it in both states. The auto on/off functionality sometimes works at the appropriate times  but the corresponding toggle seems to work backwards when it does work. The tint and brightness functionality sometimes works  but the toggles interact with each other in bizarre ways  enabling or disabling each other. This is on a Nexus 6P with Android 7.0.

Review 2: Works like a charm Just a couple of bugs  which the developer has already addresses in the details of the app - you can find it in the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""read more"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Press over the left corner not the right corner. Auto night mode kicks in on its own. Enable it once and forget about it. Soon you won't even know that this feature was not part of official nougat. UPDATE - doesn't work with Netflix. I have to turn off night mode to watch Netflix. I don't know if it's Netflix issue or nougats issue""""

Review 3: No tile appears I installed the app on my Nexus 6p on build NRD90T and went to the notification shade  nothing. Read through the comments and someone mentioned you had to run off adaptive brightness for it to work  so I did that  and still nothing. I even tried uninstalling and reinstalling it and still nothing  the tile never appears. I'll leave it installed for a bit to see if it gets resolved  but so far this is a useless app for me.

Review 4: Doesn't work for me. Nexus 5x 32 GB  once I install and open the app I touch enable night mode which takes me to a screen to enable night mode with system UI tuner and a notification appears saying that it has been enabled  but when I check the toggles nothing appears. Also the switch in system UI tuner turn itself off for some reason... Back to use twilight again

Review 5: In-apps for a SystemUI shortcut? Seriously? Another greedy dev. You are taking money for a simple shortcut. Especially if you look at real apps that actually do something like Twilight which don't have any In-apps it's funny to call this 'thing' an app in the first place.Donation for what? All the 5 mins you spent exporting in Android Studio :D

Review 6: Doesn't work on Nexus 6 Have just got updated to Android N via OTA and turned System UI onn thereafter disabled adaptive brightness and installed this app where it does says that you will see the icon in notification but nothing appears up there have restarted my phone done the whole process again but nothing happens.. Can someone help pls!

Review 7: Little buggy Takes blue light out better than anything I've tried on Android before  however it's still a little buggy. It does not automatically turn on when sun goes down nor turn off when the sun rises. Also the On switch in the UK settings doesn't always when because I had the blue removed when the toggle was in both positions

Review 8: Note  does not work in 7.1.1. To those who are complaining  this does not work in 7.1.1 for the very simple fact that there is no such mode to enable. Google  our evil overlords  have deemed it fit to deprive us of such a luxury and thus have completery removed the hidden night mode from the latest beta. :(

Review 9: The app does what it's supposed to  a simple link to the settings menu to active night mode. The weirdest part that took some time to discover is that in the settings menu  you don't tap the toggle switch next to the word on  you literally tap the word """"ON"""". (This is the only way to enable the feature)

Review 10: For whatever reason  this app doesn't work for me. I try to enable night mode on a Nexus 5X running Nougat  but no quick widget appears and colors don't change. Also  the menu doesn't get installed into the System UI Tuner as several instructions suggested. Looks like I have to wait for Android 7.1…",3902,The app is great when it works  but very inconsistent. None of the toggles work consistently. Auto night mode kicks in on its own. Enable it once and forget about it. Soon you won't know that this feature was not part of official nougat. UPDATE - doesn't work with Netflix.
org.michaelevans.nightmodeenabler,Positive,"Review 1: Reporting a bug fix Thanks for this awesome app. However at first when I installed it and enabled it  it dint work out (though I got a notification saying that night mode toggle has been inserted in my notification bar). This issue is faced by many users. A simple solution to it is just turn off your adaptive brightness settings and then turn night mode on. It will work perfectly. And once it works for the first time  you can again switch on your adaptive brightness and no need to do anything from thereon

Review 2: Edit: automatic turning on stopped working on Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Android 7.0 At the beginning it is slightly difficult to figure out how to use the toggles but once you manage to set it up it works very well. The toggle 'adjust brightness' doesn't change anything for me. Big plus fit not having to turn it off to change permissions and for covering the navigation bar. Update: recently it goes crazy. For example it changes hue depending on the flight mode being enabled.

Review 3: Works Perfectly! I lost Night Mode on my Nexus 5X because once the preview build was updated to final Android 7.0 I factory reset the phone. This app made it show right back up for me. I was even able to uninstall this app after hitting enable. I decided to donate a dollar to the developer because this was a life saver for me. The night mode was the best new feature in the preview  and I really started to rely on it.

Review 4: Edit: forgot to add -if your using a turbo 2 you have to click the actual """"on"""" text  not the toggle. And then it will turn night mode on. Hey thanks! Was bummed that the turbo 2 was shafted for night mode with nougat but now I have it :) I usually use twilight but it filters the blacks too making it hard to read. Thanks for enabling this for us! Hope Google adds it to the main Android 7 soon

Review 5: Excellent super simple! Easy to enable night mode on nexus 6 from quick pull down. However I am rooted and using pure nexus on nexus 6. Are the people giving this poor ratings even reading the instructions? I'm on PN 7.0 2nd version. Ridiculously easy no reboot required. Install night mode enabler pull down the quick pull down edit and add the night mode button couldn't be simpler.

Review 6: Works with a caveat. Initially when I installed and set this up  the toggle button wasn't showing up where it was supposed to. Only after removing this app and restarting my phone did the toggle shortcut pop up. After you toggle night mode on  it automatically switches night mode on at whatever predetermined time Google has decided. I like it now as it does what it's supposed to.

Review 7: It works! This app works as intended: enables access to Night Mode (blue light filter) setting in Quick Settings shade on Nougat. Night Mode here is a OS feature (deliberately hidden in Android 7.0 because it's half-working)  not something implemented by this app. So if you run into a Night Mode bug please don't complaining about it in this app's reviews section.

Review 8: Excellent  worked perfect! I had to toggle it on and off a few times  but now it's in my quick settings on the notification bar. Worked for my Nexus 6 with freshly installed 7.0 as a beta tester. Edit: system UI tuner wouldn't activate with battery saver mode active. I disabled it  long pressed the settings gear  and voila  success!

Review 9: Thank yo so much! The best app around the block if you're using a stock Android phone. Works smoothly and easy to apply process. Redicoulously mocking. A request to please add on dark mode too for Nexus devices  which used to be on the development preview of Android N (nougat) but went dead off in the main Update features..

Review 10: Nice app But I love this app so much because the yellow color for night mod is cool and because I can activate it from the notification bar but it suddenly stopped after installing nougat 7.1.1 beta in my nexus 6p  so I hope the developer can fix it  and it's going to be great if he can add automatic mode for day and night",4035,Night Mode was the best new feature in the preview and I really started to rely on it.

org.mysociety.FixMyStreet,Negative,"Review 1: Great idea but needs improving. Would give tbis 2.5 stars. Map doesn't always load  or freezes  even through WiFi  so frustrating  especially when out & about & just want to report something quickly: thought that was the point the of it! Quicker to phone my local council! As others have said you can't go back e.g. to view other reports. Also  I've received confirmation emails from local council but the subject isn't what I've reported  e.g. I reported litter bins overflowing or flytipping & confirmation email says noise nuisance.

Review 2: Would be a great app if council took any notice of the complaints! Have rubbish been left for months now rat food  have mould on ceiling inside block of flats which a council ' worker ' wiped with a cloth a year or so ago saying that's fixed it! Need roof looking at to find where damp coming from because starting to intrude inside flat now aswell!!! IF YOU GET COUNCILS TO LISTEN & DO WORK WOULD BE GREAT THEN WOULDN'T FEEL LIKE LIVING IN A SLUM AREA! NORTHAMPTON BOROUGH COUNCIL SHAME ON YOU  DON'T LIE JUST DO JOBS!!!

Review 3: Easy to report faults  pants trying to view others If you want to report a fault quickly  great. Log in  locate yourself  report. Job done. However  try to view other faults locally and it all falls apart. On opening the app you can view the map  select a fault and view it. There it ends. You can't go back to the map and select another. The map view doesn't appear in the menu. The back button doesn't work. Oh  and you can't exit - you have to minims then kill in your app manager. Shame. So much potential.

Review 4: Back button doesnt work This is a fab app. I've reported the same highways issue multiple times directly to the local council but it still isn't fixed. Fingers crossed for reporting it through the app which was easy to use. BUT the back button on my phone doesnt do anything so there is no way to go back a page or close the app without minimising. And there is no option to view the map/issues without starting to log a new one.

Review 5: Great idea but app broken. I've used this app before to report an issue which was sorted in days! Which was great but this app is now broken. Map tiles don't display even on latest update (writing this on 29th Sept 15) so impossible to pinpoint problem area and no exit button nor easy way to get back to map after viewing other reported problems. Also maps need greater detail to help pinpoint problem.

Review 6: Used website never knew there was app I used the website few months back when the council took away all the recycling skips in the car park for the 2 high rise flats. I complained every week direct and no help. I put it on here and suddenly the council decided to put 4 blue and 4 black wheelie bins back... Not that that's enough over 450 people but it's something and people are recycling again

Review 7: App is OK but website not good on mobile The app itself works well when reporting hazards. Just one minor complaint - the arrow button is used to autolocate whereas many apps use a tear drop symbol these days. However to edit reports you have to go onto website  but the back button doesn't work and often have to force the page to close.

Review 8: Very poor navigation. The only way to get to the main menu is to find a recent problem on the map  press it  only then you get the options to see the main menu. Who wrote the software for this app  they want shooting... I know this is a charity  but come on. The PC version is great  that's what makes this worse.

Review 9: Back button is ignored. Once you reach certain parts of this app you are stuck there for good because the back button is ignored. You can suspend the app and run another by using the home button but when you return to this app you're right back where you were with no obvious way back to the beginning.

Review 10: The app itself needs a little fixing. When you click on the details of a report  how do you get back to the main screen? I've mashed the back button and everything else. I have to fully quit the app to go back. Not good when you're making sure that you're not double reporting a problem.",4153,"The app is designed to help people report problems in their local area.

I believe using Open Street Map would be of huge benefit to both projects. If your app could be used to submit OSM map notes it could be adopted as a useful tool with OSM mapper's who are very good at capturing real time data.

Review 2: Incredibly helpful It used to be very frustrating when finding a problem with the road surface somewhere along my commute  but having no idea who to report it to. This brilliant little app removes that problem  as it seems your report to the correct local council for you. I've reported two potholes so far  and had responses within a day on both occasions.

Review 2: Nice app Very good app  one thing that is missing is the 'stroke order' option from the kanji screen. This option exists in 'Kanji Recognizer'  but because of that i have to switch from one app to another to have the stroke order. Would be nice to have the stroke order button available in WWWJDIC  if you purchased the premium version of Kanji Recognizer.

Review 3: Great kanji lookup up Great app with a lot of info on individual kanji  on and kun reading  stroke order  radical  etc. The only thing I can see that could use improvement is compound look up. It is pretty much a disorganized jumble. Fortunately it uses the same numbing system as my dictionary so I can cross reference pretty easily.

org.npr.android.news,Negative,"Review 1: Buffering issues are ruining my afternoon commute. I'm an NPR fan and in particular a Morning Edition and All Things Considered junkie. I can get my fix of Morning Edition with my local affiliate station but on the way home I depend on the NPR News app. However  the failure of the audio segments to properly buffer means that the first minute (or five) of each individual story is nothing but choppy bits of sound and long pauses. I wind up missing most of the context and spend the entire story trying to figure out what it is actually about. If the people behind the app are having trouble getting their buffering settings right then at least give us the option to download the audio files in their entirety. I've got more than enough storage (50GB). Add a setting that will either allow or disable audio downloads over cell networks (WiFi only) and you've got people's cellular data concerns covered too. Delete the files when the playlist is cleared and you're good to go. I'd be happy to spend a good minute or two before leaving work downloading all the files for ATC so I can have a more pleasant and informative drive home. Using Moto X Pure Edition w/ Android M

Review 2: I wanted to inform you that I will be uninstalling your app and ceasing listening to any of your programming. It has become apparent since the outcome of the most recent election that NPR and its affiliates are more interested in opinions than news. More and more of your coverage is anti-Trump and pro-bias. You can be informational without being opinionated. I just read an article that repeatedly said Trump """"crowed"""" instead of """"said"""". It happened over and over. That is unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing to the content being presented  other than the apparent and publicized view of the writer. The combination of the polarized coverage  the large increase in typos/grammatical errors/incoherent sentences  and the decrease in professionalism in word and phrasing choice is more than enough to show that unbiased reporting is no longer a priority to you. Because of this  I will be taking my leave from your programming and I will continue informing/discussing this disturbing loss of NPR's ethics with my friends and family.

Review 3: Content rating """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Low Maturity"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is correct more ways than one…. Multiple issues with this app on my Droid Turbo: * Audio will suddenly start playing again  long after I leave the app. So far the only way I've found to prevent this is to clear my playlist before I exit. * Very long load times  anywhere from 1-5 min before play starts regardless of network type (WiFi  3G  4G) * Playlist is more a play queue  I have to manually launch each segment of the show. * Inconsistent interaction with lock screen. Sometimes it pops up with a 'mini' player that I can (again) pause the playback after it does a random start-up  other times not so much. * Lack of settings/control - more options  especially around privacy would be nice. I'm going to uninstall and wait till a more 'mature' app comes along…. nice first effort though.""""

Review 4: As a way to find NPR shows  it's OK. As a media player  it's a train wreck. It's nice to have all my NPR shows in one place (as long as they're not more than a week old). It's just too bad that one place is this app. It's super clunky  it doesn't remember where you left off if you used any apps since the last time you used it  so long podcasts like Car Talk become a guessing game every time you start back up and try to figure out where you left off. It also  for some boggling reason  can't be controlled from the lock screen  so better just set it and forget it in your car  or you're probably going to die. Also  it can't store the podcast on your device  so if you have weak signal  you're just not going to advance to that next track. If there was any other app that I could find to listen to my NPR podcasts  I would.

Review 5: Very useful but TERRIBLY unreliable. It cuts out on average every 5-15 minutes and tries to buffer  but it doesn't do any good. It'll come back on for a few more seconds and than buffer again indefinitely. I'm better off clicking the stop & restart button to grab a fresh feed. Nothing more frustrating than hearing a great story and having it cut out at the most captivating moments. Pros: Works (sort of) over WiFi and cellular data Easy to find stations by city or ZIP Can save stations to favorites for quick access Cons: Terribly unstable connectivity Cannot pause/rewind streamed content (unlike iTunes version) List of programs cannot be sorted A-Z Cannot download a program and listen in airplane mode

Review 6: latest update has made application useless...unable to play media error... The latest update has seemed to cause a problem with """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""unable to play media"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" error occurring after about the first use of the application. (Droid razr m  android 4.4.2  182.46.xt907.verizon.en.us). Problem occurs in 4g or wifi modes. Clearing data  clearing cache  force stop will not clear the problem after it has occurred. App deletion and reinstall will allow it to work once or twice before it fails again. That is an impractical workaround to listen to Car Talk episodes! Google search references a similar problem back in 2012 !! Please fix.""""

Review 7: Disconnects all the time when your network changes: when you leave your home network  when you arrive at work  as you walk through campus and move between different hubs. Takes up to a minute to reconnect  during which time you cannot adjust the volume. The UI is poorly designed. When you select a station it show the various streams available  but shows """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""no audio available"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" at the bottom of the screen. This does not mean what it says. What it means is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""select from the list above to listen."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" A high school student could write software without these mistakes. Why does NPR?""""

Review 8: I like the app  and use it every day  but I'd like to point out a buffering problem it has: when I'm on cellphone data and an audio clip is loading slowly  or even if it doesn't load completely in the first few seconds  the audio will begin skipping. It won't pause and wait to buffer  but skip forward over and over again. This is annoying  because one has to take out the phone and navigate back to the beginning of the clip. Worse  when it's loading slowly you can't avoid this problem by pausing and waiting  because when you manually pause it will simply stop buffering until you hit play again.

org.npr.android.news,Positive,"Review 1: Website and App Syncing Needed! The app has evolved and delivers a much better experience than when I first downloaded it. I have been able to listen to NPR program without much hassle and only intermittently experience playback issues or glitches. I think that the app is becoming quite polished and I appreciate your dedication to updating the catalog of audio files by bringing more shows to the app. One improvement that I would like to see is an integration between the website and your apps. Sometimes I find myself browsing NPR and wishing I could continue a story on my mobile device at a later point if I am on the move. The addition of a saved articles or read-it-later type functionality would be awesome. Another key feature would be a unified playlist that syncs between app and our profiles on the website. I like to stream your app in my car and it would be nice to add stories I am interested in from my computer and play them on my mobile device when I get into my car. Currently  there does not appear to be any profile functionality on the mobile app. Keep up the great work. I really enjoy using this app as a source for news and culture.

Review 2: Love Hate Relationship I love NPR and listen to it throughout the day  but this app makes me feel like a masochist. I never know if it's going to work or not  but I keep using it on the off chance it does load right. I can add shows to my queue but whether or not it actually loads right is a gamble. Sometimes I load things  give up  and a couple hours later it starts to play out of the blue (really nice when I'm in situations like a work meeting  and my phone starts blaring) I'm giving it 2 stars because when it works  it's so nice (I can listen to entire programs  which I like since I have a few I like to listen start to finish  like Morning Edition) but honestly NPR - with the constant reviews and complaints about how buggy this app is  you really need to get it together and fix it. I've been using the NPR app for years now  and the revamp they did about 1.5 years ago ruined it. It'd be better if they just rolled it back to the older app than having people constantly battle the current one.

Review 3: New version running better Since my previous review  the app has improved greatly. I haven't noticed it skipping songs when buffering. The big improvement I see is adding play/pause/skip to the lock screen when the app is playing. This also connects into bluetooth devices like the Jambox. I can pause my playlist or skip a story from my Jambox. Great addition! A pet-peeve of mine with the app is the confirmation dialog every time I clear the playlist. I primarily use the app for news stories so I clear the playlist daily to remove outdated segments. A better solution would be to allow playing of all segments in a program (ie. Morning Edition) without adding them to the playlist. If you added a way for me to donate to the app  via Paypal for instance  I would give!

Review 4: Note 3 problems I have an intermittent problem when I am listening to NPR on my Samsung Note 3. The taskbar flashes blue  and if I turn the screen off and turn it back on  I can use my phone for a brief second without unlocking it  but then I cannot actually unlock it. Sometimes the problem stops if I'm patient  other times I have to use my moment of usability to restart. So far I have not had any similar problems in other apps  so I think it is probably the NPR app. I'm going to give the app 1 star because I am forced to give a rating to post the review and I want the creators of the app to take notice. In actuality  besides the bug I'm experiencing  it is a great app.

Review 5: The journalism is fantastic. Very middle-of-the-road. The articles are informative and compact. However I would recommend a few things 1) Modernize the app's look. The app looks like they haven't updated it since 2010 2) Do more international stories. The stories are very US-centric (Yes I know NPR is an publically-run American enterprise  but the BBC is a publically-run British enterprise and half of their stories are about international affairs) 3) Remove that ugly radio button at the bottom of the screen. Just have a radio section in the menu! (These are just my opinions and do not reflect the opinions of other reviewers on the Play Store or elsewhere)

Review 6: Great content  sub part execution. When selecting a podcast you are able to look through a limited offering at first with the ability to click a button on the bottom to show more episodes. However  when you go to add more episodes all it does is append the same list staring with the most recent episode to the bottom of the previous list infinitely. Also  when you make a Playlist of episodes the app will appear to let you move the order by letting you drag an episode to a new spot but when you attempt to drop it the app moves it back.

Review 7: Mostly like it Love NPR. App is mostly intuitive. Have to shut it down twice every time. I push stop  back out of it  and it starts back up again in a minute. What happened to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Quit"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in the drop down menu? 7/21/16 It appears to have updated  and with this update came push notifications. I DO NOT want random push notifications on stories YOU think I might find interesting. I very much appreciate NPR  Very much. But this app just lost a star. I think the double shut down thing has been solved though...""""

Review 8: Overall I love the app and being able to listen to some of my favorite shows any time of day. The application itself is a bit clunky  I feel like I'm always fighting with it. In some situations it'll eat through my battery in a matter of hours even when the app is closed. I've taken to force stopping it anytime I close it down. There are also times when a show will get hung-up and refuse to play  only to randomly start playing over another app 30 minutes later. Despite all of that  it's probably my most used app.

Review 9: Generally Good By far much better than the highly advertised NPR One app. Easy to access shows like morning addition  hourly updates  and all things considered. I have had issues with it crashing frequently. Recently shows have not been made available for hours after they normally would have been. For example morning addition wasn't available until sometime around noon today; I used to be able to listen to it as I got ready in the morning. Lastly  I wish it could download broadcasts for offline listening.

Review 10: Professional News Coverage NPR stands out as one of the more informing and encouraging formats for news coverage. The headlines to each segment are more focused on the topic of the article  as oppose to most internet news where """"""""""""""""Click Bait"""""""""""""""" is used to pull you in. The articles themselves also provide more links and references to the topic at hand rather than fill the page with subjective opinions. Most importantly  NPR promotes news coverage that feels balanced.""""",6984,The app has evolved and delivers a much better experience than when I first downloaded it.

Totally unstable ; I uninstalled & reinstalled & at first it found my documents then suddenly all the folders I've set up vanished completely & I can no longer access my documents etc. Is there some kind of bug with android 6?

Review 3: Open source but why is it so bad I guess I shouldn't be surprised. File managers on android are even worse than Windows.

It's designed for smartphones  though it might also be good on a phablet. Unsurprisingly  it would be rather basic for tablet use  unless you're the kind of user that prefers their apps spartan and minimalistic. Definitely worth taking for a spin.

Review 9: All I need  that's it. All I need  that's it. I've been using it for a while. It does what the description says. No more  no less. Efficient and easy to use. So far  all updates request privileges that match the functionality - i.e. no privacy leakage (no """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""full network access""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  no """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""read your contacts""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  etc).""""

Review 10: Most Trusted File Manager! Best file manager I've used that requests only the basic permissions required for a file manager. The application's entire code is available to the public if you still question whether or not YOUR PERSONAL documents and information can be trusted with this app. Thank you OpenIntents for all your great contributions to the Android app store!",4354,org.openintents.filemanager is an ad-free file manager for Android.

Please address this issue. I desperately need an app that autosaves my notes to external microSD card so that I don't lose anything while factory reset. And it gets worse. No response from the devs for about 1.5 months.""""

Review 2: Simple and minimal permissions I'd love to love this  it's simple  has few permissions and no network permissions  but it's awkward to use  and has no real options except text size. No capitalisation. Can't set up a default storage location  means you have to search to open and save notes every time if you want them on SD card. Crashed every time I tried to use in conjunction with OI Safe  and at other times. Desperately needs some options. Android 4.2.2

Review 3: I do not look favorably upon applications that hide my data from me. There is stuff that I have typed that I see stored in OI Notepad but I don't know where the heck it put it on my Android. I don't see the data directory for the program anywhere. Yes I realize that once I save the file I know exactly where it is... But in the meantime it shouldn't be hidden from me completely.

Review 4: I am using both OI safe and and OI notepad  I have encrypted note pad files using OI safe. Now when i try to open OI note pad file is crashing and i am not able to view the encrypted files. I am getting the following error """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Decryption failed due to changes in Operating system ( Android) '. Kindly help me fix this issue""""

Review 5: Crap No redo/undo buttons. Wont be added either  have used this app faithfully for years out of habit  finally going to search out something else because having NO UNDO/REDO SUCKS. IT'S NECESSARY IN A DOCUMENT EDITOR. WANT 5 STARS? Pay attention to those rating you

Review 6: Lollipop install fails Used this fantastic app for years with its Exchange CSV import  but can't install on Lollipop at all. Support email bounces  I guess this is abandonware now. Such a shame  it was the best notes app  especially with encryption

Review 7: No longer works with MyBackup Pro? I've used this app for years and relied on being able up back up notes to MyBackup Pro. This functionality doesn't seem to work anymore. Wrote to developer and never got response. Will need to find alternative.

Review 8: Needs a batch import feature Lightweight  simple  no-BS notes app. Would be perfect if I could take all the 100s of .txt files exported from my previous notes app and import them here in one fell swoop. Very disappointed that it lacks this.

Review 9: New update version cannot work with Note 8.0 Samsung GT-N5100 Have been using it for many years but After updating to new version yesterday 30th Oct  cannot get the App to work. Its keeps stopping and crashes. When is the fix coming ?

Review 3: Great note app but needs features Can't save to SD card anymore. I have had to go into OI File Mgr to move files to SD card for safe keeping. Would absolutely love if we could link between devices via user account or email that would save having to send and save files every time they're updated. No matter  I love the app for how it's made & no nonsense features.

Review 4: Great. Get it now! Awesome app. Just 3 suggestions for the developer. UNDO and an AMEND feature to drag one note to another to combine the two. And a way to send every note combined to an email in case you have to upgrade phones.

Review 5: AI NOTEPAD  my thought of using this text editor This AI NOTEPAD  certainly rated 10 from a score of 10  its easy yo use  and you can task  process editing quickly  compared to other character text editing 'smile'

Review 6: Great app and support! I love this simple  user friendly app. Plus  the only time I've ever had to contact support in the years I've used it  I received a super fast and helpful response. I'm a fan!

Review 7: Best app to use no ads and it doesnt require many things or permissions. Easy to use for creating html.txt files and etc... Like the apps it's awesome...

Review 8: Great note app Would be 5* if it was easier to back up/export notes. However this is a minor gripe as what makes it great is its simple ease of use.

Review 9: Latest update fixed the problem Happily used the previous versions for years  had trouble with an update  but developers fixed it quickly.

Review 2: Powerful yet simple Been using this for years  but now cannot edit entries. Just recently upgraded to 4.4.4 KitKat. Anyone have the same problem. If I want to add a note or change anything  I tap the pencil (edit) but instead of making it available for editing  a bubble appears with the word EDIT in it. I can still add entries and delete them  but not edit them. I tried deleting cache and data  didn't help. Then tried uninstalling and re-installing  also no help. Any ideas?

Review 3: This app used to be faithful. My phone updated to Android 6.0.1 and the app stopped working. Tried to restore database but it says  unable to open file at line 1 or read failed EBADF. Import says unable to import you might try disconnecting USB from computer. Even when it's not hooked up to anything. Before phone updated I exported this file and kept it somewhere off the phone. Thank God or I would be lost without passwords! App has been uninstalled. But I miss it.

Review 4: Issue with Lollipop I've been using OI Safe  Note and CSV Convert. Safe and CSV convert will not install since updating my note 4 to lollipop. I've got important passwords stored and now I can't access them. I get a 505 error message when installing. Please fix.(Edit) It appears this app is no longer supported by the developer. Hasn't been updated since 2012. Their email appears to be deactivated as well. They could have at least notified their customers.

Review 5: GREAT but now background lurks? Been using for years  donated £ cos it's so good at what it does. BUT  since last update (1.4.2) I've noticed it seems to load into memory and sit there when I haven't even used it  and refuses to be killed! Just loads right back up. Why? What's it doing now? Didn't used to autoload and background lurk.

Review 6: Android L issues Unable to install OI Safe if OI Notepad is already installed. If I uninstall Notepad I'm able to install Safe  but then I'm not able to install Notepad. This may be because of the new security settings in Android L. Kindly fix before the final version of Android L is released.

Review 7: Shame I have been using this app for years and have tons of data stored. It's been impossible to back it up for months now  and when I tried to send an email  the email address doesn't even work. They obviously don't care about their customers or products.

Review 8: Password type in I can't understand why I have to type in the password twice sometimes. I know for a fact I'm typing the password in correctly. This is a great day  I get to uninstall this app. So happy I get to take this garbage off my phone.

Review 9: Backup before Kitkat!!! It's not really OI Safe fault but I wish they'd make some updates to address Android Kitkat's new SD card restrictions. I lost a lot of data because I couldn't even change the backup directory to internal memory.

org.openintents.safe,Positive,"Review 1: Through a series of event of phone crash and non working OISafe  I discovered this website and read Ulrik Lauren's post and WOW!  It worked for me too. I had almost given up regaining my passwords through OISafe but just couldn't find any other password app that I liked or trusted like OISafe. I am so thankful you posted this help. Before going to the Application Manager and selecting permissions for storage in the OISafe app  I copied the two files  oisafe.csv and oisafe. xml to the root directory of the sdcard and the phone. I also put it in the downloads folder. I deleted the app itself and reinstalled it. The app said it found the import file ( it had done that before but never resulted in anything--- before the remedy of in the application manager-- and Woop  there it was  all of my data. Bottom line this is a great and simple password app and there is nothing else like it out there. I hope they do indeed have an upgrade in the near future as I was told in an email from them.

Review 2: Love it Using and dependant for long time. Never failed. Now  observed that while backing up data  it is directly showing google drive on first place. In between i hv changed handset and android version. Earlier i used to back up in sd card and then upload it to cloud. Whatever happened is good! I recommend one thing  just a pop up msg to backup whenever any changes occur in database. Not the pop up timely msg. If no changes happened  then backup may not be necessary.

Review 4: Best apps ever Ive used sony Ericsson phone as my first hp before smartphone exist  i love the apps in there that ive forgoten the name of  the one we can keep and store every pin  password etc securely.. after changing to a smartphone  ive longing for a similar apps  and i found this.. ive been using this apps for 5 years now and it never disappointed me..ive been changing to few devices now  and has no problem to backup & restore all the data..great job

Review 5: Really good app. Does what is says! I too ran into troubles importing my backup into my new mashmallow phone. But i worked it out thanks to comments from others. Install new oisafe on new phone and create new backup xml file. Copy text from within old backup xml file into new backup xml file overwriting all data. In new oisafe restore the new backup xml file that now contains your copied data. Presto!

Review 6: Excellent app for storing secure data Been using this for almost 1.5years and I particular like how it allows a secure backup  so you can backup to desktop and/or move your data between phones (It does allow to move as exported CSVs  but I suggest you don't do that) Best of all  no Ads - not many quality free apps that do this now.

Review 7: Used this for years I have been happy with this app  and glad that you can export/import databases. I had to read a review on here to know to go to settings&gt;application manager&gt;oisafe&gt;permissions allow storage. Solved my problem with importing. There should be a pop up for permissions when first installing the app.

Review 8: The BEST password manager. I didn't like the no frills feel at first. But  it makes accessing info that much easier. With over 200+ entries  I could not imagine my digital life without OI Safe. The best feature is that the app requires one system permission  and no access to the internet. Great work OpenIntents.

I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling hoping that there'd be a fix there but no luck. So I am now looking elsewhere and urge those looking for a good program to keep looking. This isn't that program.

Review 2: I downloaded it the very first time I got a smartphone  and it was perfect. Just recently there was an update and now if you mark something and shake the device it disappears. That's not necessarily a good thing. Remaking an entire grocery staples list because it was erased kinda sucks. They tried to fix perfection and messed it up in the process.

Review 3: Please bring back the clean up list feature ASAP. The shake to clean up that others have mentioned does not appear to work on my Samsung S7. It's a real bummer. FYI  for others  you can delete things from the list one by one by tapping and holding on the item and selecting the delete option from the resulting menu.

Review 5: This app was excellent when it first came out. Then it never got updated and I just got used to it.

Review 8: The original beauty of this app was its Simplicity. It was an electronic version of a paper and pencil list. The past few updates have made it tedious and laborious to deal with. I'm very close to uninstalling it. Please return this app to its original simplicity.

Maybe a few of us should get together and fork this. Past review: This app is truly excellent  thank you. My favorite feature is that it remembers past entries so """"ce"""" is all I need and it suggests """"cereal"""".

Review 3: What happened? UPDATE. Latest android update fixed this problem. So back to 5 stars. :-) I've used this app for years and loved it. But now  When I go to add an existing item to a list and start typing the name of the item  the screen which brings up matches is white on white. Tried changing themes but no help. I did just upgrade my android os to the latest so maybe that explains it but app is not as use able now as I t was.

Review 4: I've had this app for years and I just love the simplicity! For some reason Samsung Smart Switch didn't transfer it over when I changed phones so I had to go find it on the Play Store and was so surprised it's not one of the first in the search results given the amount of downloads and number of reviews. It recently got updated and the """"clean"""" feature that removed checked off items is gone. Can you please bring it back?

Review 5: Hate the update. Change it back  please or I will have to find a new one. I LOVED this app until today. 5/3/17 Thank you for the tip to revert back. Much better  but still don't like the lists being on the left. I really liked maneuvering with one hand (right). Would be better to have pick list back on top where it's smaller and more user-friendly.

Review 6: I love the simplicity of this list app  however an upgrade created an issue  please fix. 1. When adding item that appear on pick list  the text & background are same colour  can't see selection 2. Add capability to make multiple selection for permanent deletion

Review 7: Thanks so much for fixing the bug! I stayed with this app all through not being able to see selections because it's honestly the best organising tool I've found so far. I can budget my list and organise by the aisle ....awesome

Review 8: This app was great  until the new update which seems to have removed the sweep feature. Please consider bringing it back! I find it very useful for working out what's left  rather than having them ticked.

I don't normally have to type the password (copy/paste normally) but occasonally i use it to generate passwords for apps off-phone.

Review 2: Makes good passwords The passwords made here (now) match the ones made with PasswordMaker add-on in FireFox. what? Nothing changed  and PasswordmakerX also makes the same passwords. Were android hash libraries broken  but now fixed? I am also experiencing the decreasing Leet-minus-1 bug. How do I see the response to my previous review?!? Dammit Google! :-( . . . . . . . . . . . . . The fact at the source code is on github makes me feel good using this. Thanks! Needs DARK theme. ;-)

Review 3: Great update in need of tweaks This app has served me well for several years. It is nice to see it updated with a modern look. It took me a while to figure out how to manually select a profile (long press). It could use a few visual hints. Great update. Thanks for a great app.

Review 4: Works well but needs some polish Previous issues I had with this have been fixed and it's now my default PasswordMaker type app. Would be good if font used for password was changed to one that makes difference in characters like lowercase l and capital i more obvious.

Review 5: Good  but usernames are difficult This is the best PWM app I've seen for Android and may beat out the website. However  like most of the apps here  it puts the username in the profile instead of letting me use different ones for different sites.

Review 6: Since they added the import profiles option this is the best implementation of PasswordMaker on Android. It now allows me to actually sync up my password system between my web browser and phone!

Review 7: Works perfect now! Lollipop Nexus 5 Previous problems now fixed! Able to generate passwords ok. Able to save settings. Favorites are a nice feature. Thank you!

Review 4: Not to pleased with update I am sam galaxy tab and there is no new game option that i can see of as one of the previous users stated.I held down both menu option and m which brings about the options section but no new game ...it wouldnt be so bad if the edit board feature still worked than i could do it manually but that doesnt seem to want to function right aswell.All in all it was a pleasing app up until the update which brought upon some of these flaws.

Review 5: Broken and no response from developer This app would be great but I can no longer access any settings because the developer hasn't built any interface other than your phone having a menu key into the app. New phones don't have a menu key and this is such an easy fix. Until the developer builds in the three dot menu key setting this review will remain 1 star.

Review 6: The arrow buttons and algebraic notations are too close to each other that when I'm trying to analyze a game I always accidentantly pressing the notations therefore losing the position I'm analyzing. And the arrow buttons beside of setting it on its largest setting it's still too small for grownups.

Review 7: Phone or recent updates? New Droid Turbo 2 running 5.1.1 os  app now does not have 'Menu' button to get to edit board! It actually does but it doesn't do anything.... I can't edit the board manually which is NOT good.... UPDATE: OK  that was too easy! Thank you

Review 8: Can't Open PNG files In the File - &gt; open PNG file  it can't detect .png files which is kind of why I got it in the first place. Doesn't offer the option of using a different file browser to find the file either. Otherwise solid  but useless for me.

org.petero.droidfish,Positive,"Review 1: The Best I've played chess since 2nd grade so its a passion. I have at least 6 other chess apps on my tablet  and this is the only one I use every day. My only real issue with the app is the strength setting is in terms of percentage and not ELO  ELO numbers  mean a lot to a chess player; and to have the strength of the opponent as a meaningless 5 10  50%- of what? Its well below the standard of this app. The GUI is excellent  and Stockfish is of course one the best Engines. I would prefer Delphi or another engine that better simulates human club players for the 2nd Engine. The Presentation  the smoothness of the movement; good rich intuitive menus. Easily moving from Human v Human to Human v Machine allows me to practice against favored openings and key positions. The computer v Computer play allows me to see a position played out by opponents that are a little better than myself or lightyears better. I said  I love chess  I reach for this app everyday. I really think the devs got this one right: but it could be even better!

Review 2: The mobile chess interface and game to use in android. Droifish is robust  has extensive PGN & analysis support  and has useful features. I find myself converting many .cbh files to pgn in Chessbase and using them in Droidfish for study and analysis. Obviously this app is not for the casual player. Although you can add more unessential features such as kibitzer etc. (a la Chessbase)  what makes the Droidfish highly efficient is that the developer has thoughtfully chosen the most productive features for a mobile implementation. It will no doubt continue to get better due to the dedication and the developer's desire to provide us with a high quality mobile chess game that-unfairly-does not even ask us for donation. I for one  very much appreciate his work. I can play  study analyze productively. Considering that eye catching graphics do not have anything to do with chess  it is simply the most complete chess game for android. Fantastic!

Review 3: Brilliant! Amazing! Now I'v a world's strongest chess Engine in my pocket! This little handy app can't only help you play with but can also ANALYSES given position display evaluation. The most amazing part is it shows depth it's goes while searching and shows MATE after 10-20. When I'm away and some position hit my head i use it to check. Makes me gel as if I'm using my Stockfish 6 on my PC. Don't see no of downloads (many have millions download  much more than this one) but this is the best """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""portable chess app + Chess Engine"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" u can carry in your little gadget.TonsOfThanks Peter""""

Review 4: Very nice for users trying to improve their games I have played chess since the day I was (like the rest of the world) captivated by Bobby Fischer's run to World Championship versus Boris Spasky and the (then) hated Russians. For all the intervening years  the best I can muster is a (maybe) 1200 ELO. The only way to improve for me is to study the game  learn the nuances and most importantly study and play games. This app is an excellent and free start into this type of study and my heartfelt thanks to the developers for giving me this chance to improve!

Review 5: GREAT DROIDFISH Being a chess lover and a tournament player in our locality I'm so grateful to have this Droidfish GUI in my phone for free! I can practice  anayze & play using Stockfish chess engine (one of the top chess engine on earth nowadays) anytime  anywhere! One great feature is that I can load & use ctg opening books! But how I wish that Chess960 feature will be added in the coming updates of Droidfish wherein I can play & analyze Chess960 againts Stockfish & other chess engines! I'm giving it a high 5 rating!!!

Review 6: Great! Best chess program I have probably used. Tried using it against Ubisoft's Chessmaster on a AMD A8-6600K (Quad-Core 3.9GHz) with 8GB RAM and It won everytime. It even won all online games that I've tried. I still havent tried it against stockfish on PC tough. The apps analysis mode is great  though I don't like playing againt it. The Strength percentage doesn't really tell much about the difficulty. Automatic strength adjustment should do if its difficult to implement the ELO rating system.

Review 7: BEST CHESS APP EVER Best chess app in the market... at least for training and many other uses... whishlist: 1. Would be nice if the blindfold mode could be accesed from a button outside the settings menu... its tedious to look for it every time.. 2. At some place please put the name and eco code of the opening when watching games. 3. The app should open any pgn or cbg file from any position inside the phone. Every time has to copy and paste on the directory. Thankss a lot... LOVING THIS APP...

Review 8: Incredible Already brilliant  but the new feature-rich update made it incredible. However just one concern that droidfish can drain all my battery in less than 40 minutes when in analysis mode.(Pondering mode switched off). It seems to drain battery even when I have exited it. I understand it's quite an unreasonable demand  but if the developers can find a way to make it drain less battery while still provide excellent quality of analysis  then droidfish would be extraordinarily-incredible!

Review 9: Really Nice Software Overall I have to give this Chess GUI an 'A'. You can see a lot of thought and hard work has gone into this program. That said there are to items I would like to see addressed. 1: Would like a option to change to Background Color of the Engine Analysis window that pops up/ overlays over the notation window. 2. Would like to see a option for Engine vs Engine with two 'different' programs  such as for example Stockfish vs Komodo and not the current engine plays itself.

Review 10: Needs improvements No serious rated game. The natation are very near to the bottons . The game must stop if the player lost the rated game or go back to the game room.. The benefits of this are   it will help the player to analyse well in every second and to stay focus !!! Fix this.. Thanks !!! No new game option for this latest version ..Sir pls.. add premove feature   rated game  and engine vs engine game.. sir pls.. for this coming christmas that was my wish !!!",6265,Droidfish is the most complete chess game for android. It can be used to practice against favored openings and key positions. The strength setting is in terms of percentage and not ELO  ELO numbers mean a lot to a chess player. It is not for the casual player.

Why does it say """"""""""""""""warning battery mode is ON""""""""""""""""? My device isn't on that mode. On top of that  the games I have now lag and flicker annoyingly even with the same settings I've always had since the last version. Not a reliable alternative to just bringing my real psp to play games  time to switch back to playing in the real one instead on my tablet too with this app. Please fix it to work good as it always did back in your previous version  I'd be happy to rate this 5 stars again once the warning message and lagging stops... :/""""

Review 2: This emulator has potential to be the best of all emulators...but in my galaxy j7 2016 it lags pretty much...the sound is always muffled...but  after some changing I managed to play call of duty ... but now when I downloaded and tried to play God of war: chains of Olympus  it tells me to to active buffer rendering always...in non buffering mood the game is playing very good but the screen often goes black...in buffered rendering mood  it lags so much that it is nearly unplayable...even I have the frameskip rate at 8...can you guys fix this issue?? I mean  can you guys build the app as like it can play every supported game in non-buffered mode?? Pleeeeeeeease...........

Review 3: Only runs smoothly with few games I don't know if the problem is with my device or the emulator itself. Persona 3 portable and FF crisis core works without lagging but games with 2D grapics lags like hell. I played my old Final Fantasy I with no problem except laggings when in map and the music is horrible. Now playing Final Fantasy II and lags everytime  even the music sounds horrible. It used to be great until the emu only runs smoothly on games that are MORE than 100 mb. Like why? Will give the other stars once it is fixed.

Review 4: The hell... I tried every way  googling to randomly clicking   I bought and tried to installed both Gold and this version of PPSSPP but everytime I open the App the background of the letters are with a black block and everything has a black block behind of it. I tried to download a game which is Patapon 3 goddamit when it opened the controls are the one with the black block behind of it. I wasted my time I wanted to use this cause I had been using it in my old phone which is now broken. jeeez try to fix this

Review 6: I was playing grand theft auto liberty city stories and it was laggy so I started messing with the settings and I changed the mode on rendering mode settings from buffered rendering to skip buffer effects because on buffered rendering it was laggy but on skip buffer effects it's normal with no lag witch is perfect yet you can't see a thing all you can here is the sound and it sounds normal with no lag. Oh and some games you need to click three or more buttons at the same time but you can't?

Review 7: Online issues for street fighter alpha 3 max The first time i got this emulator was in 2012. I have ecstatic with the experience of playing psp games on my phone. I just couldnt stop playing. Now.... The only reason i still have it is for street fighter alpha 3 max.. But i cant play online with my friends even if theyre next to me. I set my ip changed the port on everything.. It STILL didnt work. Please fix the online issues so me and my friends can happily enjoy playing.

Review 8: The emulator itself is perfect  which is why it's so disappointing that the developer would sabotage it's own emulator. They decided it was a good idea to map the back button to BOTH the savestate menu as well as a savestate button. This means that when you go back to load a previous savestate  it is overwritten by the same button that lets you visit that menu. Truly a shame  hopefully a competent dev will pick up these broken pieces and make something half-decent.

Review 9: Have been waiting for it to support Galaxy S7. They say a fix is coming """"""""""""""""real soon"""""""""""""""". But have been waiting almost two years and still nothing...starting to think the developers have abandoned this software. Games will crash upon starting or if through a miracle you can start playing after 20 tries  it will crash in the middle of your playthrough...it gets boring waiting for a fix. S7 users forget it. It seems like an abandoned app.""""

The sound is distorted on everyone of them. Is there someway to fix this? Theres not much to work with in the audio settigs. Im on android. I gave 2 stars bc i haven't experienced it muh.

org.ppsspp.ppsspp,Positive,"Review 1: I have installed the PC version  and now the mobile. If you're reading this because you're wondering what PSP emulator is the best  PPSSPP is definitely  if not one of the best PSP emulator out there. I have never experienced any lag. Even if I do  that's not PPSSPP's fault. Don't like the controls? That's the reason settings are there. Have a bluetooth joystick for mobile? Connect to PPSSPP right away! Now I urge you to get PPSSPP Gold right away if you can. There is no difference  except the beautiful gold logo  and that satisfaction to be able to help Henrik. I myself couldn't  as I am a high-schooler with no wage. All in all  PPSSPP is one of the best  if not the best PSP emulator available. The fact that Henrik released it for free is one of the many things you should thank him.

Review 2: I love the Emulator so much but there are some bugs too while playing POP Revelation When i'm trying to open a door that we should need to press R+Analog stick and the door is going to open but the hero is keep spinning idk what is that called and it wont stop to spin :( Forgotten Sands and Fight Night Round 3 when i try to open this game it says (unfortunately PPSSPP has stopped) I hope those bug will be fixed soon ^^ i really love playing PSP games on Android Cause finally i have a powerful devices that can handle some psp games running smooth hehe thank you developer for this awesome Emulator and i hope you can see my concern.

Review 3: UltraPSP is another app that most think is a PPSSPP clone. However  this one seems to be pretty good. The compatibility is rough like most PSP emulators. However  many reviewers claim to be able to run games on this one that even PPSSPP has trouble with. We're not sure we believe those claims. However  with as murky as the PSP emulation market is  it definitely makes the app worth a shot if you can't get it to work on your emulator of choice. Otherwise  the app boasts some customization as well as network gaming support. It's not great  but not it's horrible either. At least it's free to download.

Review 5: I liked it over all but i wish you had a ps2 emulator built for andriod since the games for this are iso and ps2 emulators for pc use iso it cant be to hard to make a port for android and it would open up an even wider customer base and you could charge more than 6 bucks for a good ps2mobile emulator because while the game selection for the emulators isnt your problem it blows hard for psp port its so much better for ps2 port there just isnt a port for your mobile device you built the best psp port for andriod plz build the best ps2 port

Review 6: Works when tweaked properly: I had to keep tweaking settings for it to work well. Galaxy S7 Edge is my example. There are hella choices for rendering options and more. The trick is to configure screen resolution  frameskips  and emulated processor overclocking. Initially the default 100% psp's GHZ is choppy (audio too)  I use 200% psp's performance  achieving full intended speed on Grand Turismo. Battery drain is impressively low unless your display is bright and/or high resolution. I expect good newish phones to use this app well.

Review 7: VR HEADSETS FOR 3D GAMING This is a great PSP app. Finally an emulator that you can use a mobile phone Virtual Reality Headset with. In the Graphics settings scroll down & click on where it says Cardboard as in Google Cardboard but you can use any VR headset. Its not full VR just kinda 3D looking but its still fun to play games like Wipeout with it. My only problem with this app has been the sound. No matter what I change in the audio settings I cant get games to sound smooth. Always choppy sound. Turn off audio & games run better.

Review 8: Great but... This is one of my go to emu on android. The only problem w/ this is that some games ( AC3/SL/LR  BRS:TG  and VP:L) runs perfectly at start-up but ultimately fails by either freezing during gameplay  decreased FPS/spd until it stops  and/or lack of visual during combat/battle phase(but can still move  select  & atk). Also  maybe its on my end but whenever I try to create a game specific setting  it force close the app. But over all its one of the best psp emu out there (phone probably hates this app tho)

As others have commented  it lacks some key features; for me  the buzz-kill is the inability to add comments. A bummer as I use this to create databases of books while I'm reading them. A work-around is to add comments on your computer via SCID or any of its variants. I had to do the following: Copy the 3 files associated with the database to my local computer  change the permissions  edit them in SCID or any of its variants  copy them back onto the Android device  then reload the database (for effects to be seen  one must load any random database and then reload the edited database).

Review 2: need more features Too many modes! Analysis mode? waste of time. would be better to have a button on the main display to quickly start/stop engine in game review mode and game study mode. This will allow user to quickly start/stop engine  save battery power and analyse game without the long procedure to keep going in and out of analysis mode. Also option in setting to show arrow on display for engine move when analysing would be nice.

Review 3: Great to look at games Wish it would have better game list navigation. Haven't explored if there are options to restrict from the game list - couldn't find the control (rating or structure). Could restrict the games. However the one thing on my wishlist is the ability to remember previous filter (at-least last used one) as it saves having to enter it repeatedly (for my use case).

Review 4: Love it  but need guidance. I really love this app. But have a problem plz solve it. I m bound to import database only from twic  chessok anspd pgn file. Which only provide the latest games. How can I import old classic games of legends like  Morghy  Tall  Lasker  Fisher etc. I have downloaded the games of these players but can't open and watch their games on scid. Plz help.

Review 5: Brilliant app  works like a charm Use it almost daily and really enjoy it. I have one minor request: could we add the feature to use the volume keys as forward/backward buttons while reading a game? That would make reading with one hand while standing in public transport so much more comfortable. Thank you so much for this great app!

Review 6: Only it should use arrows for best moves in analyze mode like droidfish. And board search should have option to search only one side(white or black) piece positions. If possible it should show players clock times for pgn files with move times.( FICS ICC FIDELIVE pgn) And should show move times chart. Wish you all best!!!

Review 7: Export Issues. It's the greatest app for chess lovers.I love it so much. How can I extract my favourit games from downloaded TWIC files to a separate pgm file?? And please give sufficient instructions for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""export filtered games"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature.Thanks in Advance :)""""

Review 8: Brilliant Only wish study mode would also choose variations  not only mainline. Would make it perfect for learning openings. Also would be great if you could play the entire database  and not just one game. Scid vs Pc lets you do that  and its an excellent tool.

Review 9: Really useful Thanks for this great app. Deserves five stars. But I restrained myself in awarding it as I could not find an option to turn off the last move highlight which is bit annoying. Kindly let me know if there is a way out to do this.

org.scoutant.blokish,Negative,"Review 1: It could be great  but falls short on the galaxy tab A. How do you flip blocks? Why no multi player on same phone/tablet for car rides  etc? It has no """"home scrren"""" per second  so I have to back completely out of the game to my tablets home screen to start another game. Perhaps a tutorial would help if those things are actually there.

Review 2: Trouble with new version The icon that should give me access to new levels and game settings doesn't work. To play a new game  I have to close it down and reopen the app. What happened? I've uninstalled and reinstalled a few times...always the same. I'm bummed.

Review 3: Only reason it is not a 5 star is their is no directions  cant choose color  and can't fill pieces you can spin them but not flip otherwise this is a grate app

Review 4: Good but the game won't allow you to flip the asymmetrical pieces to explore all the other possible positions the pieces can go down

Review 5: Doesn't work on note 5 Love this game on my galaxy 5 bit all the features don't work on my note 5 please help

Review 6: Can't see menu button anywhere? Can't tell what level I'm on. No preferences to choose from.

Review 7: Often have trouble clearing for new game. Oponents in tie games are the winner.

Review 8: Meh Decent game  but the rules are not in line with the regular board game.

org.scoutant.blokish,Positive,"Review 1: Loving it -- but room for improvements Obviously  the original board game is excellent so it is hard to fail. However  there are several improvements that could be made such as better support for multiple simultaneous players  higher levels of more clever computer adversaries. Also  a few times I have noticed how the yellow player simply gives up early on in the game. How do I play other colors than red?

Review 2: Good game but could be improved It's free  simple  and replicates Blokus well. But it needs more than 4 difficulty levels. Would be nice to be able to change colors since red and orange can be hard to differentiate. Opponent always wins ties. Sometimes blocks get stuck when positioning but can always X out and do the move again. Themes and sound might also be nice.

Review 3: Great game! I love the board game Blokus  and this is just like it. Some of the other versions you don't have the ability to flip the pieces  this game you can. I have the Trigon board version also (little pieces are triangle shape). It would be great to have that version too. Can play against the program  or others.

Review 4: SAMSUNG Works fantastic on SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab 2  3  Note II  & S4 & S6. Better than the board game for the main reason of the tiny playing pieces possibly getting lost. Perfect for long trips for the kids especially  and what's better is that we all can enjoy this great game anywhere our devices go.

Review 5: Pretty dang good Three things would make this app worthy of 5 stars: 1. The ability to not just rotate the pieces but to flip them over 2. Playing as different colors 3. More difficulty levels. Otherwise  this is pretty good.

Review 6: Simple and great! Feels like the board game  interface is simple and intuitive. I do wish it would tell me when other players have no legal moves  but that's the only thing I'd change or add.

Review 7: Critical strategy thinking game Fun and makes you use your brain! You can also use it without being connected to network or Wi-Fi so its good for the subway!!!

Review 8: Excellent mobile version Has all the features you would hope for in a mobile version of this game. Single player mode included with scalable difficulty levels.

Review 9: Mostly good app I like the game and enjoy playing it. The only thing I think is missing are the bonus points for placing your single block last.

Review 10: Fun but too easy I've probably played 10 times on different levels and I haven't lost yet.

Do I have to go outside the game to understand the rules? Shouldn't have to! All rules pertaining to the game should be contained within the game itself. So until that is corrected my rating stays at 3 1/2 stars - if corrected my rating jumps to a 5.""""

Review 2: I am a longtime skilled CC player so I was playing as 3 humans against 3 computers. First it forced one of my pieces to make 4 erroneous moves because it did not force a wayward computer piece to get out when I only had one move left for that color. It should not allow pieces to enter the wrong triangle anyway. Then after I won with all 3 of my colors  it incorrectly ranked one of them as 4th place instead of 3rd. That's so bogus! I uninstalled and will never play this app again!

Review 3: JUST LIKE THE OLD TIMES the only thing that's missing is the metal sound when you move the marbles and the plastic drawers that didn't work very well ...

Review 4: Love to play this game but many of the times the game does not show results. If any of the player gets stuck in other players area it does end the game

Review 5: Flawless Chinese Checkers Except for this app  all the others cheated. Only feature missing  is the stats for wins and losses.

Review 6: Gliches When you play against the machine  there is times at the end when it will get stuck  and just go back and forth.

Review 7: why does the computer  gets too jump many spaces. huh. dont get it. didnt think thats how it goes.

Review 8: Imy component was sliding across the board without jumping over anything. Not fair.

org.scoutant.cc,Positive,"Review 1: By far the best Chinese Checkers app I've found Seems there is a lack of good apps for this game  so I'm glad I found this one!! I like that this one doesnt show you all your possible moves (a lot of the other CC apps seem to do this and you cant get rid of it ;-/ ) Wish it showed your entire move as you did it (once you click to accept the move your ball just appears in the new spot  which I think takes away a bit of the fun). But still seems to be the best CC app out there  :)

You can play this game with the original rules or choose the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cheaters"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" fast pace or bigger jumps rules. An awesome plus is NO ADS! With this game the computer player does not let you win all the time. Which is a great challenge to excersise your brain! Thank you for making this game so much fun & bring back heart felt memories!""""

Review 3: Did love it. Now disappointed in it. This was the very best Chinese checkers game I had found on Google Play Store. The AI is strong but not totally unbeatable in the short jump mode. This app is not sluggish or hesitant. However  in the long jump mode  the AI does not play fair. Only the AI gets to make long jumps. The human player is denied that right which makes the AI unbeatable in that mode. I have changed my rating from 5 to 3.

Review 4: Very well crafted free game All 3 player number options are challenging. Hours of fun. No bothersome ads. An awesome game  as of January 14  2017 anyway. All 5 computer opponents work against you  can get frustrating at times. Most of them do long jump series that aren't available to me. The program seems to read my next moves and blocks them. Interesting.

Review 5: Grandmaster Caliber Play This app is the real deal. If you can win against the AI  you are amongst the truly great players of the modern era. Consider traveling to China to join the elite professional tour if you beat this app consistently. Stay away from the border with North Korea. LOL!!! Five Stars!

Review 6: Fun but tough Excellent version of Chinese checkers. I really appreciate the lack of ads. A rarity Among free games! My only complaint is that there is only one level of play. The computer is too smart for me. If there was a choice of easy  medium and pro levels  it would be a fun and perfect game .

Review 7: It's been awhile Although I haven't played Chinese Checkers in a really long time the strategy came back quickly. Playing on a tablet against the computer is challenging but great fun and you don't have to worry about marbles rolling away!

Review 8: BNJ  Knoxville Brought back memories when play with mom & siblings. It's more exciting and challenging when playing with six people. That's when creativity is explored. Playing the computer is no challenge. Always win! Will recommend...

Review 9: Such a tricky game I love it I downloaded it via F-Droid so I guess this is also Open Source! Has its bugs here and there (e.g. the big buttons not fitting in the layout  etc.) but man its so fun! Well done

org.scummvm.scummvm,Negative,"Review 1: 2 annoying issues introduced in this version. Up until this version the mouse worked flawlessly. Even in this version after setting the mouse back to """"laptop mode"""" the mouse click in-game doesn't behave correctly. This can be fixed by changing left click to """"tap"""" instead of """"normal"""" however the GUI then becomes buggy and extremely difficult to use. The other issue is the back button now invokes the ingame scummvm menu where as before the back button was used to skip scenes and skip dialogue. Now you have to try and use right click to skip dialogue however more often than not it doesn't work. What was wrong with having the three dots down the bottom right corner to invoke the menu? Thanks for adding the many filter options and finally getting FM towns filtering working. That's brilliant! Thanks for all the continued effort! Its greatly appreciated.

Review 6: Love it Works flawlessly with DotT and Sam&Max. The Legend of Kyrandia will crash the game when you try to heal the bird. Closing the app completely and rebooting your tablet has no effect. Bit depressing if you're forgetful like me and forget to save frequently. But seeing as this is the first time I've seen the app crash in the 10 months I've used it  I'll give you 4/5 (will there be a fix to Beneath a Steel Sky ? can't go past linc  where you have to blind the eye and pick up the tuning fork.)

Review 7: Since the update  I've had problems with my games which is a bit annoying. I'm not able to play the Legend of Kyrandia games - it says I'm missing the kyra.dat file  but I got this and it's placed it in the right folder. I even tried to download a newer version on Scummvms website  but no luck. The sound for the Discworld game has become strange and it says it's missing an instrument?! What's happening? Everything worked great before I updated :-\

Review 8: Used to love the app I've had this app for a while and it worked really well. I loved playing my old PC games on it. But recently it just doesn't open anymore. It will open  show a loading screen  and then just close again. I would really like to keep being able to play my favorite old games  but obviously I can't right now. And I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the app  too  and that doesn't work. Please fix or tell me how to fix it?

Review 9: The emulator seems to operate smoothly. However  I take issue with the clumsy  counter-intuitive controls. For example  I can't just activate a menu item or in-game object by directly clicking on it via the touchscreen. Instead  I have to drag a cursor to highlight the item and then touch the screen to activate it. This is especially difficult when one needs to use the scroll buttons to select game paths within the emulator's interface.

Review 10: Keyboard issues Game seems to run smoothly  but I can't get the keyboard to work on my Galaxy S4 or my kids Galaxy S5. The home button trick doesn't work on either one. Only pulls up the options/credits menu. Needs an on-screen toggle for a keyboard. Return to Zork requires you to answer questions with a keyboard  or you can't continue the game.

org.scummvm.scummvm,Positive,"Review 1: Out of all the games that have been released for Android  I find myself mostly returning to my SNES emulator and SCUMMVM! Playing these classic game tickles my nostalgia button like nothing else can. Tip for those not happy with the controls: on the main menu go into OPTIONS &gt; MIDI tab and then tap the """"""""""""""""Mixed Adlib/MIDI mode"""""""""""""""". Exit the app and launch it again. This option changes the controls from touchpad-like to direct input. I personally prefer this mode. The only thing I'd wish they'd change is an option to make the font and button size larger on the main screen  as it's hard to select the small buttons with my chubby fingers. AWESOME APP!!!""""

Review 2: Another Awesome open source project! :-) On the face of things and after testing with a few of the free games lawfully offered through the ScummVM project  I have to say this seems to work pretty well for those! :-) // Sadly though  the family of games I *really* wanted to run on it - The Mohawk based games Myst and Riven - Don't seem to be working at all for me (""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Unstable"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" then """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Game data not found""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  even though I've dumped the entire CD-ROM onto my SD card!).

Review 3: Amazing for classic Sierra & Lucasarts nostalgia! I loved using ScummVM to relive childhood gaming  and now that I can play it on the go is truly remarkable. For those saying it doesn't load  it does - you're just impatient. TIP: don't download from Google Play  this is an outdated build. Go to ScummVM's website  download the latest STABLE build (1.6)  and what goes from a 20-30 second load up was reduced to 3 seconds. Also change the input to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Mixed Adlib/MIDI"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" to get direct touch mode so you literally point and click. Perfection!""""

Review 4: Awesome  Black Loading Screen. The BLACK Loading Screen at start up goes away after about 10 seconds for all those people that think it's broken. Works like a dream I love DOTT and it works as it should. My only thought is fixing the touch screen interface  I have read a few reviews and some people say it's there under audio  however on my HTC ONE I don't have this option so on a smaller android screen it would work better as opposed to the drag and click mouse style that is currently implemented. Other than this I am happy and it works.

Review 5: PC games for your mobile device If you enjoy classic PC games like the Monkey Island series  Kyrandia  or The 7th Guest  this is the emulator for you. Unlike DOSBox  SCUMMVM only emulates the functionality necessary to run your favorite games  and as such is able to do so much more faithfully. You'll need to download the correct plugins to add support for certain games or series. I suggest you only download the ones you plan to actually use. If you add more games later  then download the appropriate plugins as you need them.

Review 6: Great App But With Some Problems I enjoyed playing many adventure games using this app. It feels great! However  this app has some problems. Beneath A Steel Sky's mouse pointer is black instead of white and the menu (which it has a speed adjustment which requires to get a certain item in LINC) doesn't show up when I hit the back button. Then  Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror's cutscenes are often choppy. EDIT: I downloaded BS2's DXA's cutscenes on ScummVM's website and they run smoothly.

Review 7: Great compatibility with natural controls I've played Loom  Full Throttle  and the first two Monkey Island games with this. Perfect each and every time as far as I could tell. Controls are great with a choice between a touchpad style of moving the cursor or regular touch screen controls. Either method is a great fit for mobile with nothing lost in translation. The thirty second black screen is annoying but it consistently loads. In a way it simulates waiting for the computer to boot.

Review 8: Awesome! I found that changing the left mouse click to the volume down button and right mouse click to the volume up button  improved my experience with this emulator massively. There are a couple of little bugs I encountered  the volume settings and subtitles speed settings worked intermittently and sometimes on a rare occasion the keyboard button would disappear. Currently playing Monkey Island 3. Would love for a built in option to screen cast so I could play using my TV.

Review 9: UPDATE LOST MY SAVED GAMES!!!!! I've used ScummVm for years and love it. I'm sure the new update is good and I love that the point and click is back to the old ver. of staying w ur finger... BUT... All My Saved Games Are Gone!!!! If I have to redirect everything to another folder  etc  please let me know... but REALLY not cool that I go back to continue my game  and I can't load my games or my saves!!!????

Review 10: Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos (In my top 10 PC games) Cd talking version plays perfectly with hidden direct touch option (check mixed adlib under midi settings to enable workaround). As if remade for touch devices. Way better than dosbox experience. Replaying game after 20 years and it is easier on my phone than PC! Beautiful.

Review 3: The service won't run (will stay on 'idle') unless the phone HAS Internet access and if it is running and the phone loses Internet connection the service will change to 'idle'  so it DOES REQUIRE connection to the Internet to work?

Review 6: Not fully functional without root Nice idea  maybe  but you can't get an ad hoc WiFi mesh network unless you have root access  and this app requires extensive permissions to work.

org.servalproject,Positive,"Review 1: Resilient automated (and simulated) shared folder of files for whole network using app . Ppl complain  u need root. Not for the file share! i installed on all 3 of my devices ten minutes after dloading. I use dropbox for file transfer btween devices. This app saves me about ten clicks each time I want to transfer a file. Also no internet needed 4 that. App can make phone to phone networks. This is the next big tech after cellphone towers I guarantee you.. Clever. Really clever and i cant wait for the next power outage. Never seen anythingblike this before. A+. Also  if your Internet gets wonky  unclick the networks and uncheck the 'active' box  then force quit the app. App needs a shutdown button but... Super impressed.

Review 2: Great app  better the Firechat This is the best app to get for emergencies or for use anytime when you need it. 1. It does not require you to create an account to use which does require an internet connection so it is useless if installed after the net goes down and there is no reason to make an account for something that supposed to be used when there is no service as Firechat does. 2. You can share the app directly with another person you chat with and do not require to be on the internet or have cell service allowing others to install and use the app should the need arise. It is all and all the best app I have used so far.

Review 3: Calls are surprisingly clear and low letency  at least on the same network. Requires some reading to really get how each option works. Note to some other reviews: root is only required for AdHoc mode  which is an Android design limitation. Other modes work fine. Resilience is lacking  which is forgivable in experimental stage. I find myself every hour or so having to cycle the services and Bluetooth off and on to reconnect to peers. Plus  some other apps (like OpenGarden FireChat) will kick off AdHoc mode and possibly other interference.

Review 4: Im inpressed I know that the phone has to be rooted in order to use the ad hoc connection but it is still very impressive and I would like to see it continue to improve   keep up the good work  a good improvement would be the ability to use the phones radio to use other phones radios to communicate sort of as a Mobile cell tower so that you can send messages through a whole bunch of other phones to get to one phone assuming the phone can reach. Just a thought

Review 5: I Used it. It worked Moto Razr with Moto G I tried to use it a couple of times before. But it worked this time. Its a brilliant concept. Do let me know if I can be of any help. The only problem was that there was a delay in relay of voice call from the host to the receiver. The Receiver's voice had a huge delay of more than 30 sec. Also  the broadcast message kept popping up. There wasn't any option to delete or mark as read. Great work! Cheers Sid

Review 6: Very cool Seems rough around the edges a bit  but was able to set up my own 2 peer network with a nexus 4 & a 5  using one as the wifi hotspot  and free of any other connections! Made calls well  with even less lag than when over my regular wifi network. The range extenders would be handy  but even a This will be very handy! Hope you guys keep developing it! The whole over all concept is amazing!

Review 7: Cool! Seems to work on HTC Wildfire S but NOT on Star N9599T (MT6589T chipset). The idea is well cool! But I havn't yet got enough friends with smartphones to test it. I envision using it on festivals where the extra use overwhelms the local infrastructure. Glastonbury Festival  where 1/4 million extra people arrive by a small village  is the worst I have attended.

Review 8: Root required  yes  fix Get a cheap android phone that can be rooted  (check online first) use it as your Serval Mesh node allowing full use. Connect your expensive device if required. Share this with friends & family  workmates  church  PTA. ect. The more that have it and use this the better the community. Great app  thanks  keep up the good work.

Review 9: Excellent idea This is a great idea  and my phone is rooted so it works. Problem is finding others that are willing or able to root their phones.

Review 4: Great  but.. I just switched to Sickrage and it seems it's not 100% compatible. For example if I try to add a show I get 'ERROR: null' message. Maybe the Dev can check it out. Thanks!

Review 5: Doesn't work Can't connect to my sickbeard at all. An example would be nice  but it's not available. But it's simple setup  and plugging in all the parameters -> no connection

Wasn't able to close and end phone call normally  have to reboot my phone for that. Not ending phones  locking. Please fix that problem ASAP. Thanks. Can't put even 3 stars because that not even OK.

Review 2: Not good Sorry guys  I've used this app before on various phones and tablets. It's been ok but quite buggy - not ending calls  locking up etc. However with this version on my new tablet (lenovo tab 2) it won't connect to sipgate. I tried various options but eventually gave up. I then installed the Zoiper 1.5 app which was connected within a minute or 2.

Review 3: Has some problems Nexus 5 stock: Call in progress notification does not go away  will appear even if call is not answered. All setting including password stored in plain text on SD card Have not rechecked: Doesn't pause media at the start of a call. double tap a direct dial  one call is made by sipdroid  one by my phone. Exclusion ([0-9]{1  6}) fails.

Review 4: Eats battery. No option to prevent startup Edit. 2 years later since my first review. Still no option to quit  no option to tell it not to power on at start. Eats battery. Works  but not use friendly. not easy to contact developer to ask for support without getting to a pc and making a forum account. And then they don't listen  even for two years.

Review 5: Not up to date While the featureset is nice  the app suffers from a lot of freezes while changing settings. Every time you change a setting it disconnects and reconnects to your server instead of waiting for you to save. It's quite ugly. It's a phone app and the first screen you see looks nothing like a dialer.

Review 6: Great app  but the latest update has removed the stop option You need exit for all kinds of reasons  such as when I want to use one of the SIP accounts on another device  or to save battery. Now we have to go through the phone settings menu just to stop the application. BRING BACK THE EXIT COMMAND.

Review 7: This just doesn't work I think you had to get in on this a few years ago. I just get 404 errors inside the app  it just endlessly tries to register something and used about 50%battery in twenty minutes. Nice idea  but it isn't worth my time. Don't download  something phishy about it... Sorry

Review 8: Dissappointed... This version now has NO quit function so the only way to quit out is to force quit the application from android applications info screen. This is really stupid as I have no requirement to have it running at all times  please change this back to the previous functionality!

Review 9: good  but has issues As others have stated  when the phone rings about 75% of the time the contact box does not show up and I am unable to answer the call. I have seen no solution for this and is not ideal to call the caller back.

Review 2: Better than other sip clients Definitely it is way better thanks csip simple ... Needs some improvements for the interface and proximity sensor integration. Can't receive sip calls but still can make sip calls and international calls thru my sip account

That button acts as a kind of bug activator. e.g. if we write ര് and later go to another line and returns we can't proceed unless we deleted ് which automatically follows the newly written words and the ര് becomes ര.

Review 2: Buggy My words added to dictionary for English (US) doesn't work properly.. Even after touched to save the word  again n again it asks.. When I directly go to settings and dictionary their multiple entries are present  if I open one the duplicates disappear  but at the end of the day the saved words are not at all saving n making typing a tedious task.

I used to use Swiftkey which has a very good Arabic word prediction feature. Is there a way I can manually add a list of words from a file? If not  please try to add it in the next update. Another thing you can try updating is  sliding on the spacebar to change language rather than long pressing it and then selecting it from list of keyboards. It will save time while working on different languages.

Review 2: Awesomely simple and feels awesome All credit goes to the developer team. Awesome app. এত সহজ বাংলা অভ্র কিবোর্ড হতে পারে  কল্পনাও করিনি! Just two suggestions in bangla avro layout make the full stop (.) a দাঁড়ি dari.

Review 3: Lot better and smooth than google indic keyboard. Would request you to improve transliteration as sometimes its not coming up with desired results.

Would request if Incognito mode is also added  so that we don't have to install and switch frequently to other keyboard apps to type confidential info.

Review 4: Bring back the ‘symbols on long press’ I have been using this app for over a year for Malayalam-Inscript & English and this is the best there is. The ~ and ZW keys in Malayalam Inscript layout are a great help. But please bring back the “Long press the keys for Unicode symbols” function which was there in the previous version. It was very useful.

Review 5: The best app for indic languages I use this app to type in 4 languages namely Hindi  Sanskrit  Tamil and malayalam  the app works flawlessly and I have not had any problem till now.

org.smssecure.smssecure,Positive,"Review 1: The BEST app for SMS/MMS  hands down. I've compared this to all the top apps available and if you're intelligent enough to know that security and encryption are two vital aspects of messaging and texting  you'll appreciate everything this app has to offer. The developer is responsive and helpful  and Silence's features and customization options are exactly what I want/need in an SMS app. (Dev - can we get any more colour options for the app overall?)

Review 2: It's okay but  Suggestions/Request! It's okay but needs some improvements added to make it even better: 1 • a favourite contacts speed dial bar at top of app. 2 • unread badge notification counter fix. 3 • ability to link/group same contact details. 4 • a link in attachments to send/share GPS location. 5 • fingerprint unlock support in passphrase. 6 • a built-in sheduler/auto timer for sending sms/MMS. 7 • latest emoji update needed.

Review 4: Good But.. I cannot seem to get my exchange contacts to come through on this app and it doesn't appear to indicate via Tesla when new messages are in the inbox via icon. Which is too bad because I rarely look at the top bar for updates. Other than that the app is great. Way better than other apps as it actually supports MMS messaging as you would expect.

Review 5: This is great. I discovered something that signal does not have - the toggle to have received messages state what time they were SENT as opposed to received! I personally find this single feature invaluable  causes less confusion and I don't know why no other SMS app has this.. anyhoo the rest of the app is great too. Love the dark theme!

I hope not to jinx things  but look no further if you need a SMS texting app. This one is brilliant!! (I only wish you could forward messages and more easily set up group messages..)

Review 2: I imported public keys but could not use them in K9 to encrypt emails. Instead  the app insists on creating a new key pair or importing secret key also. What if secret is not available (as in most cases). I never had a problem like that with APG. I also find UI of APG superior. Unfortunately  it looks K9 dropped support for APG.

All I tried were far worse than Nokia. But this gives me a full feature calendar with no sync required. Clever hack. Google shouldn't have needed you to fix the flaws in their calendar.

Review 2: Absolutely useless. Based on what I read I thought this was the offline calendar I wanted. Tried everything I could to create a new calendar. Finally decided it wasn't worth wasting my time any more. Wish I could give it zero stars.

Review 3: Attention all Developers Any app with personal information if you do not include reminders and security they are useless

Review 4: Doesn't work Keeps going back to setup. Doesn't separate calendars. Not intuitive. Crashes repeatedly. JUNK

Review 2: Simple and easy I just wanted my calender to be stored on my phone and backed up there. This app is perfect for setting up the calendar and their other calendar app works great to export the Google calendar to a local file and then import it into the locally stored one. Thanks guys!

Review 3: Essential Could not do without this. I don't want to have my calendar info synced to anywhere. Absolutely perfect when used in conjunction with Calendar Widget by +1Labs and Google Calendar. EDIT▶Dislike material design changes  so I'm staying with version 1.5

org.tasks,Negative,"Review 1: Useless sync with brain-dead Google tasks Desperately needs to sync with a more capable platform such as Toodledo or similar. It's a shame because I was enjoying the Astrid vibe. The UI is a bit quirky. When selecting a category  there should be a save icon to return to task entry. As it is  you have to press the escape Android icon twice... once to clear the keyboard and once again to return to the main task entry form. Easy enough but not at all intuitive. As a stand alone task manager  it's great but Google tasks? Seriously? You can't sync repeating tasks between devices.

Review 2: I've loved it but it suddenly stopped working! I've used this for more than a year and have come to depend on it for everything I'm planning and have programmed followups for everything from when my dog's heartworm medication is due to when I need to remember to renew my car's emission test. For the past several days all it says is """"""""""""""""unfortunately tasks has stopped"""""""""""""""" whenever I attempt to launch it. Not good! It let me report this  but it has not been fixed. Please fix asap so I can go back to loving it.""""

Review 3: This is a great app  but they're trying the well worn path of """"make the app as ugly as possible then charge people so it stops hurting their eyes"""". Have developers forgotten that there was premium version of this app in the past  then they said thanks for the money  it's now going to be free for everyone and we're taking away the features you paid for? Themes should be free to anyone who ALREADY BOUGHT PREMIUM FEATURES. Apparently dev responded to this review but I can't read it!!

Review 4: Very disappointing In Google keep I can make task lists that are perfectly sorted  and even color coded. For example  a note that says """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""August tasks"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" or """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""personal tasks"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". And everything in that list is sorted into its own note. This app  no matter how I sort it  every task  under every category is just jumbled together on one page. If the play store would let me get a refund I would. Let the buyer beware I guess.""""

Review 5: So much potential This has nearly every feature under the sun. Its Achilles' heel is there is no way to sync all the information pertaining to tasks across devices or at least automatically back it up to the likes of Drive or Dropbox. Although it can sync with Google tasks  it can't edit Google Task categories  and most information pertaining to tasks can't be synchronised and backup is strictly manual. Also  comments and timer logs on a tasks seemingly can't be deleted.

Review 7: Not syncing with Google Tasks Initially  it synced with Google task and imported all items from there.. But now  it is not syncing my updates with google tasks.. I have checked with all sync setting multiple times and tried with manual sync also  but no Luck.. Sync from Google task to astrid is working  but from. Astrid to google task is getting failed. Please fix this soon.

Review 8: pretty  but sorting issue with existing manually-sorted list Beautiful compared to the app I've used for years  but when I opened this app  it changed my original manual sort order (of a travel packing list) to a seemingly random ?smart sort?. Changing the sort order to ?manual? didn't correct the order to the original. Uninstalled.

Review 9: Please restore to normal padding Extra padding for tasks has been recently added. This made the app less handy to use beause when I want to mark a task complete  4 times out of 5 I end up in a task edit screen instead of selecting the task checkbox. Besides that less tasks fit the screen because of this change.

Review 10: I like it BUT what happend to the centered checkboxes like the ones on your snapshot. I really hate how the tasks looks now; so much I had to uninstall the app. I care so much about looks.

org.tasks,Positive,"Review 1: I tried many apps related task management  i am really happy with Astrid Tasks app. Thanks for Astrid team. Only thing it makes me unhappy is whenever i change my device  all the tags vanishes and all tasks accumulates under non category. So again i need to create all my tags once again and re arrange task tag wise. That's tedious task work itsel. It would be great if all task remains categorised even after change in device or re-log in. Ine more thing i can't share task with others. Folder required  Kindly fix this issue i really love this app. One good thing i found in this app is one task can be tagged under multiple tags. Unlike it is not their in google list. Kindly respond to my comments Thanks

Review 2: Thanks to Alex for creating this app  it made me seriously more productive over past few months  some improvements i wud suggest: 1.Quick Add bar to add multiple tasks quickly 2.Multiple selection shud be available for priority  delete  tags 3.Description for tasks can be wider 4.Image attachments can be shown as thumbnails 5.Editable comments 6.Option to auto add gps coord like omni notes(no internet required) 7.Some kind of screen widget like ticktick which allows quick adding of tasks even in lock screen 8.Old style priority levels(bars instead of dots) 9.Swiping right left functionality on tasks

Review 3: I used Top Task List constantly on my Windows phone and it was absolutely brilliant - and this is the closest thing I've found to replace it on Android. I can create categories for my tasks and create all kinds of reminders  set due dates  priorities and link it to different calendars in Google Calendar. In the list view it's easy to read with a simple design that has just the right amount of formatting so that the design isn't taking up half the screen space. I just got the location plugin so now I can be reminded of things at my usual places. I love that. Highly recommended!

Review 4: Loved it!! Almost perfect I had decided to switch from the old tasks app by TeamTasks and was looking for an alternative. This one had similar UI to that app and had a lot of additional customizable features which made this app much more useful. My only problem with this app is that while setting reminders  it requires 2 additional taps if you want to enter a custom time on a custom date. Few other apps as well as the old tasks app combined the date shortcuts & date selection option to one screen thus not needing the additional taps

Review 5: Just one more thing..... Admittedly this is the best or unique task manager on the market... and I have bought everyone over year period. So well done.. all others seem to be a carbon copy with no tangible innovation. You however have finally broken the mold... applause!!! Just one thing would be mega useful. When the task alarm comes up it does not show what category or in my case what project it comes from. I have hundreds of tasks and about insane amount of project. Everyting I get a reminder I have to then open it up.Please fix

Review 6: I downloaded Todoist  Wunderlist  Any.do and To Do List and uninstalled all when I found Tasks! Love the simplicity and ability to see at a glance my checkbox list for today  tomorrow  etc. Great for people who don't need to share lists! Prefer Google Keep for notes + template lists that may need to """"keep"""". Tasks is excellent for every day lists in place of paper+pencil lists. Only day 2 and loving it. Thanks Alex and Tasks ... Way to go!!

Review 7: Simply WOW I've tested almost all the related apps and this one is by far the greatest. Love the in depth settings and the ways in which I can customize the widget. The only thing that I'm missing is having the date for each task on the right side of the title and not below (widget). It would look so much better. On a galaxy s6 the font for the date is very small on the widget  even at maximum size and it's very tiring to the eyes

Review 8: An excellent todo list application Excellent application that has great notification features. The fact that it integrates into my calendars is a big bonus. The one thing that I would like to see is for it to get time and date information about the task from the title like todoist does. It even syncs online with google tasks!! The widget themes are a great addition and the look beautiful with multiple options.

Review 9: I've tried many to-do apps and organizers but I always come back to this one. It's super attractive (so is the customizable widget) and colorful  it's easy to use  it's functional and my favorite detail is the timer. I can easily set it when I choose the task at hand and I have a record of how much time was spent on it which is super useful when managing my time. Love this app!

Review 10: I have been using this app for about a year. It is stable  consistent  and well managed. I have rechecked others but still think this stands out as the best """"to-do"""" available. I particularly like being able to set repeating tasks from the completion date and that tasks can viewed and edited from Google Tasks on my laptop. I've tried the rest and this is still the King",5136,Astrid Tasks is an app for Android. It lets users create and manage lists of tasks. Users can also add and delete tasks from the list.

org.telegram.messenger,Negative,"Review 1: Something is seriously wrong with the setup process... Pass code initially recv'd was unable to enter as either the app or my cell auto skipped by that screen thus invalidating that code... Unable to find an answer in the FAQS messaged support asking if it would effect the functionality... Response did not answer my question and from what I can tell one can't simply enter a new pass code anywhere once installed.. Therefore uninstall  cleared cache and reinstalled.. The new code support sent obviously no longer worked and a new one was never recv'd... Another problem as when you click the pass code not received another one is sent but kicked out of the pass code screen no water to get back to it... A message in the app has a link to click if pass code not received and a timer pops up saying a rep w call you back... Clicked 2x's and no return call after waiting much longer than the less than 2 min displayed... Deleted as this is simply annoying... Had their support answered my question correctly to begin with don't think I'd be as irked wasting my time or called as didn't ask for a call back so don't add a msg saying someone will when they don't... also annoying... Work in IT and completely understand issues happen either w the app even possibly my error yet not much patience when misinformation... Delete...

Review 2: Telegram is a fantastic app/platform that easily can compete with WhatsApp. My big issue with it on Android is that notifications don't work. They apparently don't use Android's built in notification system  instead choosing to roll their own (as is the case with their encryption as well). While I'm all for innovation  the system simply doesn't work. While using this app  I missed over 60% of the message notifications  and wasn't aware I had received a message until I opened the app. Since this is a messaging app  that obviously won't do. If it weren't for this one problem  and they used a tried and proven encryption method  this would 100% be my go-to messaging app. I still love it  but the fact that notifications don't consistently work is unfortunately enough for me to not use the app.

Review 3: The app is ok...the fact that you can retract nd edit messages nd not disclose numbers is cool... But i have issues with the restriction policy.. Lets say i have issues with someone personally someone owing me money  i text them nd they report me as spam.. I feel its ok that i cant reach that particular person.. But then i cnt chat in a few groups i can't relate to friends from groups in private  i can't text friends i haven't texted in a while  for 3whole days unless they text me first.. Just because of one person..one darn person who feels its not OK for me to ask for what's mine.. That just seems unfair.. Please kindly revisit that policy Cuz people even report as spam for wrong unfair reasons most times and you claim to moderate.. Yet u just block anyone that's reported..

Review 4: I just started using telegram today  and the app has failed the first task it's supposed to do. Import my contacts!!! If I can't see any contacts then how am I going to chat with others conveniently through this app. Major turn off. I've tried everything from your bug reporting page. Close app  restart  changed contacts to international number  changed contact name and reverted. All still lead to the same result: nothing seen in contacts. The only way I can now see contacts is by adding them manually but damn why the heck would I manually add over 100+ contacts again??? What a let down. AND I'm very sure that the contacts that I tried adding have telegram too  and obviously I've allowed the app to access my phone contacts DUHH.

Review 5: I absolutely LOVE telegram  but there's one little problem I'm having. You guys know that thing where you have to enter your phone number? Well  there's no problem with that  but I'm going to tell you guys straight; People sometimes join fandoms  and they don't want people in real life to know. A lot of people use telegram as a their main means of communication  and I would LOVE a feature where you can hide your phone number so no one with your number can see your display name or profile pic. Anonymity is important. Sure  anyone can go and just get a fake number to register on telegram  but that's really inconvenient. We want anonymity! Please  telegram?

Review 6: How am I supposed to take backup of my chats? There are so much unnecessary features in here. But not a basic option like backup. So irritating. And the privacy is very bad. Any unknown person can just search my name and text me and view my profile picture. Worse  it adds those unknown person to my contact list of its own accord. Now if I wanna change my number its says it will send my new number to all in my contacts. What kind of privacy policy is this? Its so dumb. Im not even able to remove those unknown people from my contact list. It just keeps adding them. I even deleted them from my mail contacts list. Still it just keeps coming. So frustrated.

Review 8: Hello Telegram Team. I have tow requests (Attention Please): 🚩Add #Persian language; You know that a lot of telegram users are Persian language  it is very important for us. 🚩I can't send my themes to @AndroidThemesGroup; I think Because Telegram does not allow peoples from Iran to join public groups  it is sad! Thank you. تیم تلگرام، سلام! من دو درخواست دارم: نخست اینکه زبان فارسی را اضافه کنید؛ این برای ما بسیار مهم است و همان‌طور که میدانید بسیاری از کاربران تلگرام فارسی زبان هستند. دوم اینکه من نمیتوانم تم‌های خود را برای شما ارسال کنم؛ فکر میکنم به این دلیل که تلگرام دسترسی‌های لازم را برای کاربران ایرانی مسدود کرده است؛ این خوب نیست! با سپاس.

Review 9: Please add a feature in which the size of emojis can be modified just as the size of the font can. Also  on group chats could there be some sort of thing that could let us know who read the messages? (Update: I'm so happy that Telegram calls have finally come  but could the sounds for like calling and ending the call be different? I mean it's just not really subtle for the ears and well I don't know if this is important or anything but personally I find it really annoying to hear but that's just me I guess. Also whenever you take a photo through Telegram  it always appears to be really sharp and edgy. Please fix.)

Review 10: Loving the bot API but one thing I don't understand. Why replace """"""""""""""""message"""""""""""""""" with """"""""""""""""channel_post"""""""""""""""" in the getUpdates JSON result for channels? Inside the full root of for example """"""""""""""""data.result[0].message. chat.type"""""""""""""""" and """"""""""""""""data.result[0].channel_post. chat.type"""""""""""""""" has a """"""""""""""""type"""""""""""""""" value which can be """"""""""""""""channel"""""""""""""""" or others which defeats the purpose of switching """"""""""""""""message"""""""""""""""" to """"""""""""""""channel_type"""""""""""""""". This causes me to add extra unnecessary perimeter tests.

org.telegram.messenger,Positive,"Review 1: Constantly up to date and always ahead of every other IM  sometimes also ahead with features not present even in some other applications like (video players  image editing  cloud storage and media management). I really like it. I admire their product life cycle and their releases which are very often and fast  Telegram must have good scrum masters  developers and management for sure :D I would like to see more attention involved in the Cloud Storage management  because it is very easy in the current version to delete accidentally a chat and therefore lose all your cloud storage with that chat. Maybe we can have a lock with pin/password/email confermation to delete a chat which we mark as 'important' and on the other hand to delete 'unimportant' chat could be without asking for password/pin/email confermation. I would also like to see a better organization of chats  groups  channels  so for example  when you have 4-5 private group where you are collecting info and stuff about 4-5 cities (1 city for each group)  then you want to have those groups grouped together in a 'master group' called for examples 'Cities for holiday'... and some other improvements are needed :) Good job!!!!!!!!

Review 6: Download this now! This is the greatest messaging app I've ever come across. Seriously  the interface is seamless and actually IMPROVES with updates.

I can share websites  gifs  pictures  and more with just a click. The only thing I'd love to see in the future are stickers with more variety of skin tone. I use this app with my bf (I'm black and he's white) and sometimes I like to send him cute character stickers. Current stickers are still adorable  but it'd be nice to send him one that really reminds him of me! Bottom line  you will LOVE this app. I've been spoiled and can never use anything else. 💙💚💙💖

Review 8: Dear Telegram team  Thank you for your effort  your app satisfy me a lot  just some small thing I hope you can do to us. First  I personally like a small size font  but I had found out that only the text messages are apply to the font size we had set  but the font for musics  participants name  web contains  the contains of message we tabbed to reply are still remain the default font size which I really disappointed with. Please make all those font size apply to what we preferred. And secondly  please figure out somewhere to make the messages we sent be able to show who had received and read status. It is very important to me  so do some other peoples. I am willing to look forward for your respond. Thank you.

Please verify my observations and  if correct  please consider fixing.""""

Review 2: No support for NFC tokens You don't do anything that OpenKeychain doesn't  and fail to do some of what it does. Back-porting features from OpenKeychain  you missed the most important one - it's ability to use keys on NFC-accessible hardware tokens such as Yubikey NEO. I think this omission is far more important than your ability to accept public keys from another phone via NFC. Uninstalling.

Review 3: File selection - not working It is grate to have a posibility of encrypting and signing messages @ Android. Anyway it is not easy to sign or encrypt a file. When choosing the file from the selection dialogue it appears not to be selected when the control gets back to the app. Fortunately there is a walkarround (by IO File Manager) over this issue but still it has to be fixed.

Review 4: File encryption error? Tried to encrypt a file. Choose type """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""file"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" then browse to either local mem device and it wouln't chhose file and tried external drive also. But the filename isnt shown in field after chosing it so the app sees nothing to encrypt. Is this a kitkat 4.4.4 ver issue or did i miss a config option?""""

Review 5: Needs some serious usability updates For starters  importing public key from clipboard is something I thought a standard feature for a long time now  yet this app does not have it. User interface is an outdated Android 2.x UI which isn't fantastic. It does the job  but it's just hard work to get anything done. Easily fixed with a better UI.

Review 6: I was having a problem with importing a key from the clipboard  bit it turned out to be an issue with Android itself and the way the clipboard seems to mishandle blank lines and spaces. If you have trouble importing copy to a notepad app  edit the key to match the original  save as .asc instead of .txt  and import the .asc file.

Review 7: Problem decrypting files with passphrase I want to be able to decrypt a file with a passphrase  in order to view its contents. I don't want to save the decrypted version to another file  which is the only option offered  since saving the decrypted version defeats the point of having it encrypted in the first place.

Review 8: Ugh  don't even try to import keys made with GPG4USB  the windows carriage returns won't be recognized by this app and you will be stomping newborn puppies to relieve your frustration soon enough. If this app is the ONLY way you are going to encrypt/decrypt stuff  yay. For me  it was completely useless.

Review 9: Can't get it properly setup. Sending/encrypting works. However  decrypting does not. Can't find the appropriate secret key  keeps asking for passphrase.(even when created with APG) On CM11 does not show menu button  so can't change that settings either. (As described on github). Thus  worthless to me...

Review 10: Secret keys not secured Overall  a very good app. The only flaw is a large one. The pass phrase is required to send mail  but not to export the secret keys. With an unlocked or open device  anyone can export and transfer all secret keys. An encrypted password to perform this function should be required.",4204,There is a problem with keys that have certain attributes (I don't know whether the problem is with the Cipher attributes  the Digest attributes or some combination of the three) If there is a private key associated with the public key  and you import them  then try to edit them  you find many of the edit-key widgets greyed out. If it is a DSA/Elgamal key (like mine is)  then the DSA signing key is not recognized as a signing key.
org.thialfihar.android.apg,Positive,"Review 1: Thank you for the great app. I found that I can edit the capabilities (Sign  Encrypt  ...) of my key using your app. I needed to add """"Encrypt"""" capability to my primary key  but no other software had this feature. But the problem is that when I change the """"Usage"""" to """"Sign and Encrypt""""  save  export  and then import the key to GPG  it shows that while the """"Encrypt"""" is added  the """"Authenticate"""" capability is cleared out! If you could fix this problem it'd be great. I propose you change the dropdown list to checkboxes for """"Encrypt""""  """"Sign""""  and """"Authenticate""""  so any user could choose their desired capability. Also  it shows my """"Encrypt only"""" subkeys as """"Sign only""""! It seems that there's a problem there too. Thank you again for the great app.

Review 2: ***WARNING: THIS APP HAS KNOWN VULNERABILITIES AND HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN OVER TWO YEARS*** This was a great system when it was regularly updated. However  it hasn't been updated in over 2 years. OpenKeychain is a fork of APG that is much more currently updated. I have switched to that system. Changing over k9mail is pretty straightforward; the crypto provider just needs to be set to OpenKeychain in each account. Don't get me wrong. I loved its seamless integration with k9mail. It's just that I need something that isn't going to be full of vulnerabilities because of simple lack of updates. APG paved the way  but it seems someone else needs to take the torch (and OpenKeychain seems to have done it).

Review 3: Near Perfect Keychain Management For Android What more can I say? This thing is nearly perfect. I was looking for a way to handle PGP on my phone and every recommendation pointed me this way. What I like is that it is flexible in the way that it handles PGP content  whether it be keys  encrypted files  clipboard content  etc.. I seen that it has good integration with K9 email client  but I've done just fine using it with gmail on my phone with no problem. Importing secret keys is pretty straightforward and easy. No serious issues with this app so far.

Review 4: K9 mail integration Love it! Being able to send PGP encrypted signed mails is a great feature for mobile. The only reason people say the keys """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""aren't secure"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is a limitation of mobile hardware. Supposedly the entropy collection on mobile devices is inferior to that of traditional hardware. If you're that concerned  generate the keys on your desktop and import them like I did. Also  storing keys on your phone is considered a security risk. Small request though. SHA512 signature support?""""

Review 5: Finally  a key management solution! This app is great for key management. The keys this app generates work well in Thunderbird's Enigmail  and the integration with Blue Mail is excellent (almost too seamless!). I had a little trouble finding out how to import a key exported from Enigmail -- if you have a private key already  you need to delete it before the option to import a for shows up.

Review 6: Best PGP manager for Android I use PGP on a regular basis and this integrates well with k9mail. The last update makes the usage of the app pleasent. The interface is gorgeous! I haven't personally tested it since the last few updates  as I already have one  but last time I used it to generate a key it took almost 15 minutes for a 4096 bit key and from what I heard it was an insecure.

Review 7: EXCELLENT APP! I never though I'd be able to send a sms encrypted with a 4096 bit RSA key but here we are and I can do exactly that or encrypt my emails. Thank you now nobody can read my texts or email. Oh nearly forgot great to see it creates 4096 bit RSA key by default most clients are 2048 by default. 5 stars for sure. Will keep an eye out for any other apps you may do.

Review 8: Best there is! Development & support back to full speed. K9 mail integration is excellent. K9 itself is feature rich but confusing for novices  however very worth effort to learn. Recent K9 updates are great improvement. AGP + K9 is best of both worlds. Looking forward to additional features  but very pleased with current solid & robust combo.

Review 9: Great Does all it says it would. Easy to use for blind. Requests 1. can you upgrade it to full certificate generation. 2. Integration with other email clients. 3. support for web identity 4. Allow search of all contacts on all key servers automatically or on 1 cklick. Thanks for a well thought out application.

Review 10: Brilliant After trying 50 odd other pieces of crap with mysteriously high reviews  I finally found Cinderella. Ugly but under the terrible UI is a pretty beautiful piece of app. Hats off to the developer. Clean up the UI  spend some time with a UX person and this is an app you'd be happy to pay for.",4783,WARNING: This app has known vulnerabilities and hasn't been updated in over two years.

Bet he thinks adobe air runs on feary dust. Runs well sgs5

Review 2: What does it take to clear the damn history? Removing this junk. Frequently opens on some previous page I viewed (not necessarily the last page.. It's like Tint picks a page it likes and keeps returning to it). This happens even though I use incognito by default. I have even manually cleared history and cookies  then hit the 'back' button  and it brings me to a previously viewed page. It's also just a crappy browser.

Review 3: Flash support? Nope. Anyone who knows anything about Android and Flash will know that Adobe Flash Player does not work on Jelly Bean and above. The only way to watch Flash streams is by installing.specialist Flash browsers which process said Flash via the cloud. Tint browser is NOT a Flash browser  therefore a Flash plugin won't make a blind bit of difference.

Review 4: one fatal flaw - no bookmark sync unable to sync with my bookmarks. the native browser this is based on has hundreds of bookmarks synced that i can also access from chrome. i prefer this browser to either and am having to share pages with the native browser using flashify to bookmark them and retrieve them. very sloppy way to get much needed functionality.

Review 5: Anthony Taylor Sir  for someone the types and spells worse than a inner city 2nd grader you should remain quiet. Seriously  you sound like a retard and reading your post actually hurt my brain. I'd be embarrassed especially in this day and age of spell check. I'm sorry if I offended any retards with my comparison.

Review 6: Nice replacement for stock browser There is a bug though which makes it inconvenient when restoring tabs. If set to ask to restore tabs on start  and you chose to restore them  it won't show the page from an external link which launched the browser.

Review 7: Disappointing A little buggy  a little slow  imperfect web renderng. I'm looking for an alternate to AOSP or the stock android browser which is bloat free and quick but has no ad blocker. Promising browser but needs improvement.

org.tint,Positive,"Review 1: Fabulous Simplicity Well  I'm certainly not an expert on Android but contrary to one of the reviews here of flash being a no goer then as I live on Youtube I have to say I have no issues whatsoever with Tint browser Flash on Galaxy Ace 3 (4.2) merely by installing the last android adobe flash 4.0 and this trendy little browser plays Youtube videos perfectly along with in webpage vids too. The UI is truly stylish and is easy to navigate  no rotten adverts  many different settings and it 'IS' open source and although it's not the best browser I have I'm giving it 5 stars because I've had no issues at all with it (unlike many other brands) and in all reality I think some users expect above and beyond expectations for totally free softwares  some don't read the instructions on the lid and some don't have the specs to support some softwares (imho) There are ALWAYS room for improvements with anything but I'm not complaining here at all. It's a keeper for me Tint Browser team  have a fabulous day  Steph

Review 2: Well built but some issues exist! This browser proved extremely snappy and beautiful in my phone . Just to say I have a crappy device with a meagre 256 kb ram and 30 mb storage left . So I was searching for a browser like this. But the only reason for my unistall was that it crashes everytime I open the Google search . Or just search any thing . But websites like youtube and Facebook were running real smoothly. I swear this will be my permanent browser if u fix my issue. Atleast gimme a reason why its crashing!

Review 3: Really good  w/annoyances Overrall pretty good. Biggest annoyance is there is no way to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""clean up"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" when done. All tabs stay open forever unless you close them individually  or force the app closed with the remember tabs option set to never. Also needs a close button to make that option valuable at all. Also  if Flash hangs the browser  it hangs all tabs and all attempts to navigate anywhere (some kind of internal freeze).""""

Review 4: Some great features I have tried A lot of browsers and this is one of the very few that will always display the address bar and the tabs. No more having to scroll down to get them to reappear  they are just there  all the time. And I love the customisable home button  excellent and necessary addition for me. Would love to be able to change the tab  address bar colour for  something A bit brighter  but so far this is my fave browser. Thanks!

Review 5: Best Browser After Chrome / Firefox This is by far the best browser outside of Chrome and Firefox. It is filled with options and the ability to customize behavior and UI to your liking. Most importantly  it stays out of the way. It doesn't clutter the screen  bringing up the menu doesn't result a screen dominating set of options. After Chrome and Firefox this is the best along with the AOSP browser. Great app!

Review 6: Great browser Works great and I can use folders in the bookmarks  don't know of any other Android browser offering this. I just have two issues: 1.In tablet mode it's sometimes unresponsive  especially with multiple tabs (no problems in phone mode). 2. In phone mode it doesn't display the three dots and CM11 disables the menu key  so I can't get into settings...

Review 7: So far impressive. Fail on page memory Not many permissions required. Https works..at least to google. Seems fast. But if you close a page u don't want others to see. It goes to home page...That's ok. Select the BACK option and the old page comes back up. Should either exit TINT or stay on current page. NOT GO BACK TO THE PAGE YOU NO LONGER WANT TO BE SEEN.

Review 8: Nice and quick - runs very well on my Nook HD+ with 1GB ram. The only thing that prevents it from being my tablet browser of choice is that there is no tab management in full screen mode. You have to switch out of fullscreen mode to go to another tab  then switch back to fullscreen mode through the app menu.

Review 9: It works. Very good app  much more than I had expected. It isn't perfect however as tabs often disappear if you go to home. This turned out to be a dealbreaker for me so I decided to uninstall the app. However  every attempt I make to do so is a failure and the app will not remove itself.

Review 10: Fantastic browser. Great browser. I have paid for browser apps that pale in comparison to Tint. Bloat free and fast. I have tried quite a few browsers and scroll lag was always an issue.

org.tomdroid,Negative,"Review 1: Disappointing I have Tomboy notes in Debian synced between different machines with Dropbox. Tomdroid seemed the obvious way to add my phone. Copied all my notes to the SD card to start with  then found I could only import ONE FILE at a time. So I moved them to where Tomdroid wanted them to be. That worked. Sort of. No notebooks. Everything apparently random. I was going to try putting a link in the folder that Dropbox links with to the Tomdroid folder but without notebooks it's almost unusable. Pity. Next version?

Review 2: Worthy Attempt Not very usable without feasible sync and notebook support. rainy server is not something the avg user can install. As is  presents a random list of notes. Good as a stand alone basic note app or to read a limited number of notes from tomboy

Review 3: Unable to view/edit rich format text I tried the latest version 0.7.5 on both my S3 phone and Note 8 tablet but neither can allow me to edit or view the note text with formatting as shown in the screenshots above. Please help me make it work. Thanks.

Review 4: looks good but seems to be dated and not working with tomboy notes now - ive got two computers syncing that create directories with the notes on this it just makes a not in the root which the newer version of tomboy dont seem to pick up ?

Review 2: Works awesome Wow. Got it going in less than 5 minutes. Using with btsync rather than a server. This is just incredible. Thank-you! My only wish would be to use the notebook feature. But really that is so trivial compared to instead awesome secure private note sync with almost no effort!

Review 3: Getting much better - keep it up! As a longtime user of tomboy on Linux I need to have easy access on my Nexus Tablet. This now almost does it all. Congratulations. Synching still is not totally intuitive yet but getting better all the time with each new release.

Review 4: Great It's great to have a fully open-source alternative for note-taking apps like evernote  with syncing capability. It could use a few additions such as support for notebooks like on the desktop client but it's great to have this much already.

As some others have pointed out  if you use the power saving mode in your phone  Orbot won't be allowed to transfer data in the background  thus preventing apps like the Orfox browser from working. Either turn off power saving  or change its settings to allow background data. This should be highlighted in the app's description  since it's not very apparent to many users  and they might give Orbot a bad rating for something that isn't its fault.

Review 2: 1 because you say that you replied... To a review from 6/16/2014  however  your comments only start in mid September THIS year. Fact is  I only download this TO comment. Could be malicious  I don't care. Whoever the entity in Kansas is  that reroutes all of my Internet traffic to them can watch me until I die.

I WILL keep battling until u realize that. ;)

Once and only once google had me verify myself because I changed my IP thingie  and then shortly after my phone overheated and broke on me. Had to restart it  NOTHING to do with anything besides texting from my actual phone number worked..So it blocked all sites & apps & I couldn't do anything about it.

Review 5: Just cancel the app I can see why this could exist  but just take it down. There are so many easy ways for criminals and people to get to the deep web which has a lot. of child porn  Illegal guns and drugs  ect. I know this because I found it. I didn't watch any child porn or get any guns or drugs I mean I saw the links on the hidden wiki which is easily accesable on tor.

I'm not sure if there is something I'm doing wrong on my side. Is there anyway someone could help me? I would greatly appreciate it.

Review 7: Pointless What's the point of Orbot without a firewall? All the firewalls require root and the ones who don't (VPN-based) are leaking data. At least that is the case on my OS (4.4.4). And what about exit nodes? I can't login to any site because some exit node could steal my identity. Even if I could protect my data  most web sites don't work when I'm using Orfox. So basically I can only surf the web and nothing more. Even Google doesn't work. I appreciate the developer's effort  but there are just too many problems.

I love this app so much but it has some problems whenever I bring down the notification bar it always say I have been monitored.. after going into hidden wiki no matter which link I press on it becomes broken.... the VPN do not work.... do not think that I am the only person with this problem I have friends family few other office colleagues who is facing the same problem ever since.... by the consensus of more than 130 people I want the developers replay regarding this message......

Review 8: Amazing It's so great having tor easily accessible like this. And this latest update was fantastic. I've had little to no functional problems with the app itself. Tor by nature is hit or miss but the app works flawlessly as far as I can tell. Transparent proxying is sick too! My only complaint is that the graphics in the app don't scale well to larger screens. It get pixelated. But that's just cosmetic  and it's not like I'm going to be looking at the app a lot.

Review 9: Better After my scathing criticism of previous versions this update is better. I still don't like the gaudy interface but at least it now shows I am actually connected to the Tor network.

org.totschnig.myexpenses,Positive,"Review 1: Great app  But I have a suggestion Interface and the simplicity make userfriendly. However It would have been nice to have an option/dashboard which consolidates all accounts' balance  income and expenses which should be in default currency. Currency conversion should be done automatically under present exchange rate. This would help to know how much one has spend per month from all accounts. At present  we got to go to each account and calculate by ourselves.

Review 2: Great replacement for Microsoft money I have used Microsoft money version 1.0 since it's release in 1991. It only works in a DOS emulator in Windows 7. It is now time to get to the present. This app does it and imported all my data. Thanks. Sorry  had to drop down to 4 rating. It needs to have account balance display beside every transaction so I can verify my future uncleared balance _ unless I'm missing something.

Review 3: Good  but Needs more flexibility with regard to grouping periods A good app that does what it says on the tin. As setting up scheduled payments relies on the Grouping Periods to set the payment frequency  the fixed choice of period means that certain transactions cannot be scheduled such as those for every 30 days  fortnightly  and quarterly. It would be great to set custom payment frequencies to cover such cases.

Review 4: Switched from MoneyLover  and this is so much better! No bloat  simple UX.

Also  shouldn't cloud sync be part of the contrib key anyway? Looking forward to a reply. EDIT: Thanks!

org.transdroid.lite,Negative,"Review 1: Download path? Biggest problem with it is that you can't choose download path  it automatically downloads everything in a default path. Second  it takes ages to load. Why can't it keep the torrent list and just update it in the background each time I open it? I am sick and tired of waiting so much every damn time I open the app. Also  the RSS feeds don't even load if they have more than 50 entries. It just tries to load them and after some time you receive an error message and that's it. Literally the only functionality of this up is that it puts torrents in your seedbox. Doesn't do anything else.

Review 2: *cI am dropping my review to two stars. It has been ages now and STILL I cant multi select files to move them. Please please add this it makes things so slow moving them one by one! **... I use it remotely to a server.in order to move my files around  I have to go into each torrent and manually change directories for each. It would be great if i could multi select and move files in bulk from the main screen  and not have to go into each one and do them one by one so slowly. Also  always so many error connections...

Review 3: Crash on some torrent adds I cannot add local .torrent files. When I click on """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""adding torrent from file""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""  then navigate to the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Downloads"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" folder  the local .torrent files are greyed out  I can't select them.

There is non-existant help for this app  and the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""setup guides"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" on the site are mostly vaporware. The server configuration screen isn't very user-friendly  it took me a while to realize the port entry was at the top. Not that it helped.

Review 5: Company doesn't play well with others This company is causing others to pull their products from Google play if they integrate with it. Instead of working well with others it forces other companies and all their customers to suffer. It was obvious the company was using their product and they were getting full credit  but they didn't work something out. They just forced everyone to suffer  and yet for other companies they let it continue.

Review 6: View but can't Add I can see the torrents on my phone but can only see them  I cannot add from my phone. Using 'Transmission' on Late 2009 iMac running latest osx EC. Phone is LG G3 running Marshmallow. I get the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""greyed out"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" local .torrent issue that nearly everyone comments about... Seems like you may want to fix that.""""

Review 7: Recent updates have connection issues with uTorrent. Takes a while to bring up torrent list. Then when a torrent is remove it spams a bunch of connection errors until it is closed and re-opened. Still one of the best UI's  but it's becoming less useful. Edit: Works fine now on GS6  but timeouts and errors still happen on 12.1 pro tablet.

Review 8: Utterly Confusing Setup Port is """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""hidden"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in Advance at the very top. It's incredibly easy to miss until you see it the first time. But even then it sometimes just refuses to connect to deluge even when it has before.

Review 9: Not working any more Can anybody help me. I reinstalled this app and now I cannot connect to my torrent server which is transmission running on my readynas. When I go on the Web portal of transmission it show I'm on port 8181 but transdroid configures it as 9091. I love this app but can't seem to get it working anymore.

Review 10: Unfortunately doesn't work for Deluge servers. Kicks back """"Error during Communication. Check connection"""" Connection is fine. Triple checked.

org.transdroid.lite,Positive,"Review 1: A stunning combination of utilitarianism & minimalism I rarely feel the urge to leave a review of any app but Transdrone physically moves me to leave a review it does exactly what it is supposed to do in such a simple and yet beautiful way  once you have it configured it just works no questions asked I mean I enabled the labels plugin in deluge about a week ago and today I noted that Transdrone had picked this up and allowed me to label downloads as if I was using the webui or desktop application I was just flabbergasted that it works so well! Its such a rare thing now to come across such a well developed and thought out android app and I applaud the developer.

Review 2: New material design version is fantastic! Looks great and fixed the constant server errors too! I have used Transdrone for some time now  but it was always frustrating because of constant server error messages  and then when really bad  it would take a bit of juggling wifi on and off and force stopping the app to get it to connect again. Since the update to the new material design version  I've not once had a server error message--not even when batch deleting a bunch of torrents (which used to cause server errors almost every time). And on top of the functionality  the new interface is fantastic!

Review 3: Almost  needs compact interface Works well  my suggestion would be to add a compact interface as a single torrent takes up way too much UI space on the overview. Dame for the files list there should be an option to set it to compact view; not everyone is using a big tablet. Also easier selection of groups would be nice like on transmission web UI. If I have 10 files under a folder I want to be able to operate on all of them by just changing the root  not by having to change each entry one by one. Good work though!

Review 4: Easy  quick I must have somehow had old version. Thanks for adding port option. Functionality is limited  as is the WebUI on torrent client. No stars off for that. Makes monitoring torrents easy and organized. Where this really shines is seamlessly adding torrents or magnet links from the web or torrent search apps like the torrent client is right on your device. Using ttorrent pro with NAS storage on an older tablet. Run this app on my smartphone and add downloads at work which are done when I get home.

Review 5: Perfect Works with most seedbox hosts. I've been using it with Arc Welder on my Desktop with external storage enabled to use it on my PC as my primary torrent remote. The only issue I found is that the mobile version (not the tablet version) does not have access to RSS feeds  and when adding a torrent  you can only add one at a time. The ability to access RSS feeds on mobile and adding multiple torrents at once would make this easily a 5 star product.

Review 6: Great front-end for Deluge Works fantastically for me (Deluge running in a Docker container). Had to do some fancy routing to get it connected from the WAN because the Docker container tunnels out via OpenVPN  but after some trial and error on my end  I could connect without issues using my DNS hostname. Not to mention that the UI is polished and I haven't encountered a single bug.

Review 7: Works perfectly It does what it says. All features work perfectly. The only things that are missing are 1)having the info about the free space on server 2)renaming torrent files (very useful option to make torrent names compatible with media server library). To do that I have to use the transmission remote I have on my win PC. It will be 5 stars when this option will be available.

Review 8: crashes a lot When I open the details of one torrent to change its folder or label  and then I go back to the main screen  the app crashes 99times out of 100. And yes  it could use some development  talking about the UI and functionality. But it is still one of the most useful apps for me  using it with Deluge 1.3.10  thanks for developing it! Keep it up guys!

Review 9: Looks like a good app  but it automatically tacks on the port number to host address. I use a custom port number on the WAN side that port forwards to the Deluge 8112 on the LAN side. Suggestion: add an input field for the port number and just prefill with the default number for the selected server type and allow the user to edit.

Review 10: Perfect app! You can throw in almost any torrent client out there with ease and as a bonus it has support for reverse proxy as well!. For all of those that have set up their clients with ports other than the default  you can easily change the port that transdrone uses in the advanced settings. It's literally the first option!",4662,Transdrone is one of the most useful apps for me using it with 13.101010.

org.wahtod.wififixer,Negative,"Review 1: Mostly useful for techy types. Great monitoring tool  but I didn't notice that it increased my WiFi reception  or stabilize my connection. Even on a large phone (LG Spectrum II)  I found the text output of the monitoring screen difficult to read. The app reminiscent of the old PC OS tools that reported everything the OS was doing. If the developer would use a more graphic oriented interface  it would be more useful to lay users. Other users complained that WiFi Fixer was a battery hog  however  I found using the settings to stop monitoring of services kept WiFi fixer from zapping battery life. However  this effectively reduces WiFi Fixer's usefulness. The developer should update the interface to specify which category of services to disable. For instance  disable monitoring screen handlers  app managers  but continue to monitor network activity. I found this app less than useful  but safe for my phone. The developer should consider updating the UI to a GUI  and add selective monitoring  and packet buffering to help stabilize connectivity  and well as a warning when the phone is switching from WiFi to carrier data  or when the WiFi signal is too low to maintain a connection.

Also disabled WiFi ON cmd. in Android Setup. Didn't want to wait forever. Rebooted tablet  and WiFi was switched on without my request. Most unfortunate.""""

Review 3: My wifi speed is insanely slow whenever I'm connected  however my 4G is significantly faster. I get pretty fast download speeds and upload speeds so I know it's not my internet  and this is a problem with multiple different locations. When I use this app it makes the speed quite a bit faster  however it disconnects me from my wifi about every 10 minutes or so. I can't tell what is more frustrating  having to wait 4 minutes for something to load  using my 4G all the time an risk going over my monthly limit  or having to deal with getting disconnected every 5-10 minutes.

I have a Droid RAZR M  which from I have heard  really don't like connecting to WiFi but instead  even if there is a really powerful connection  forcefully """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""temporarily"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" disconnect themselves. I'm not sure if this app helps  because it seemed to try to stop my phone from disconnecting itself  but also failed at first. I installed another app to help with my WiFi issue and I haven't uninstalled this one and it seems as though the apps help each other  but of course  I can't guarantee that.""""

Review 5: Did not help This application did not help my problem. What I am having is it connects to the Wi-Fi then it goes to obtain the IP Address and I get a message saying my internet is slow. Though I am not sure how that is possible when my phone is the only one having the issue of not being able to connect to my WiFi. And I just recently got this problem yesterday out of nowhere. My laptop  my moms computer and both of my parents phones can connect. Just puzzled that mine is the only one what cannot connect please HELP!

Review 6: Didn't work for me. All it does is turn your wifi off and back on to reset it. Well guess what  I wouldn't be using a touch screen phone if I didn't have fingers for crying out loud ! Problem for reference: Galaxy S3 recently started losing connection if I moved more than 5-10 feet away from my router even with a very strong signal. After installing this app I can see it rapidly cycles from connected to disconnected  then app turns wifi off  then back on  scans  connects then disconnects all in a constant loop.

Review 7: Messes up settings My modem is also wireless and I keep that disconnected in order to have it run high performance and let the router do all the wifing..... This app started changing up settings the second I opened it without notifying me or asking for permission...didn't fix what I downloaded it for either so I'm uninstalling (need app that will fix WiFi authentication error without me having to go downstairs late at night to unplug and replug it which seems to be only way it works)

Review 8: WiFi no current network (marshmallow only) In marshmallow only. I think the only thing that is missing in your app  is the ability to get full power on WiFi even when you have your phone in power saving mode. I sent you an email with full description. Many thanks for your app  I understand the efforts of the programmers and I know it's not easy. Your app have 5 stars from me  but I don't think is OK to donate if the app is not working for my proposes

I might as well click flight mode on and off and gain a lot on battery live...and no reaction at all from developper on ANY of thecomments. Bad support on top so not inclined to promote or pay for this app

Review 10: Subjective assessment only... No perceptible increase in connection stability overall. Xperia Z2 WIFI still repeatedly drops with or without this app enabled. (As an aside  Marshmallow / 6.0.1 update seems to have triggered of wifi instability  hate to be in the anti MM 6.0.1 update camp  even after a factory reset  wifi keeps dropping even when next to access point  this didn't happen on lollipop.

Review 7: Wow As of now this seems to have solved my problem. My Samsung tablet was defaulting to 2.4ghz and I was getting very slow speeds  and Samsung software does not allow me to choose 5ghz as default or preffered. Running this app seems to have forced my tablet onto the faster frequency  5ghz. Speeds are now 10x what I could achieve before on 2.4ghz.

Review 8: WiFi fixer Excellent app. Everyone should use it. It should come pre-installed on all phones! It also appears to rectify the suspected WiFi connectivity problem I thought that I had with my HTC One X and later my One M7.

org.wikipedia,Negative,"Review 1: Up until recently  this app was the single best way to use Wikipedia  and I would have gladly given it 100/5 stars; it was amongst my top 3 most used apps. However  lately  likely as the result of some update  it will spontaneously crash roughly 1 out of 3 times I open a new tab  and  even worse  roughly 8 out of 10 times I attempt to add an article to a reading list. In each case  when the app is restarted  it will have reverted to a state prior to the current session. Since  while exploring a new subject  it crashes as often as twice per minute  it has effectively become nigh unusable. The current 3-star rating I've given is an average  in the hope that this issue will be addressed soon: when working properly  it is easily a 5-star app  but in its current state  I wouldn't give it a single one. Please implement a fix for this issue ASAP  it is an irreplaceable tool for kickstarting research on a new subject!

Review 2: Don't bother with India/Pakistan articles. They are biased the administrators seem to allow revert-wars on the articles many editors from are even trying to sell their own books by referencing them in the citations. Known nationalistic websites are used as sources as well. Do your research elsewhere for those subjects. When I was editor I was asked in email by both Indian and Pakistani users as well as administrators to help them get their POV pushed into those articles. I think the same thing can be said for the religious articles too. The only decent articles are on science watch for pharma articles those are problematic too with edit-wars and over egging the negative addictive and carcinogenic effects of vital live saving medication (drugs) based on personal agendas. Wikipedia where history is whitewashed. That should be the motto.

Review 3: Ruined the app in the new update with 2 big problems. First is the feature of changing the entire interface language is very dumb. Now I am unable to view other language wikis and still understand my app. Fix it or make an option not to have it. Secondly  Wikipedia has ruined the link popups - the read article button no longer shows unless you scroll down to the bottom of the preview. This is retarded as I can no longer click the button no matter how much of the preview I've scrolled through. Waste of time. Even worse is that I've been unable to downgrade - any older version instantly crashes upon searching. Also still had my older issues of a Visual Editor not being available for mobile and also not being able to edit more than one section at a time. Please respond.

Review 4: You are asking for donations in order to remain independent  and rightly so! I'll be happy to donate as usual. However you might receive a few more donations if you add an option to remove the dreadful  intrusive """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""cards"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" from the front-end of the app. They are ugly  too numerous and above all invasive of privacy. Many people hate these so-called cards  but you have ignored the requests for control over them. By the way  you say that we can """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""quickly jump"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" between various things in your """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""what's new"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for the latest update. Wiki search for """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""split infinitive"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" and find out about English grammar.""""

Review 5: Please fix the app. I enjoy using this app very much and use it regularly for every single initial query I make about any subject. Nearly every subject I look up is covered and many are covered in extreme depth. The apps features mostly all work fine. I have noticed a tendency to crash when too many tabs are opened simultaneously or when hopping from hyperlink to hyperlink. However  the single biggest flaw is the reading list feature. Not only does it usually crash every time I try to create one but it also won't let me log in. So I can't edit anything  contribute anything or save any reading lists. This need to be fixed.

Review 6: """"Explore"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" is beautiful  but the wrong direction The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Explore"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" feature is beautiful and clearly took a lot of work. I'm sorry  but I don't like it and don't want it. Please do not fall into the social media trap of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""trending"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" articles  and """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""you might also like."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Wikipedia is a serious encyclopedia  not a frivolous social network. At the very least  *please* allow the user to customize what appears on this screen. I thank you for your effort  but this recent release is a step backward in my opinion.""""

Review 7: Wikipedia  Very Informative  but not at all 100% correct ... Do not take the cited as absolute truths. They may seem right. Remember however a person who has signed up for an account can ruin a good article  by editing it. If you do know what has been written as being a 100% true comment  and other remarks as not so. It may be a users way to rewrite history in the article you are reading ... believing the fskse info may cause course failure. While that major couse depended on your final grade. The better your final mark when applying to graduate school is very real!

Review 8: Didn't know what I don't know. Accessing the Wikipedia site is easier and so handy to save entries for offline reading. Learning something new everyday. Keep discovering that there are a lot of things to learn about that I had no idea I would be interested in. The more I use this app the more find I didn't know as much about some subject as I thought I did  and now I've become insufferable and even more of a """"""""""""""""know it all"""""""""""""""" that doesn't know enough. Want to see a more layman's way to submit info into articles  as I find it confusing.""""

Review 9: Disappointment over lists. I am very surprised and disappointed that at the end of 2016 this app still has severe a reoccurring problems with saving & syncing articles to your account permanently. It just doesn't seem to work  I frequently lose my lists. And I've only ever used two Samsung Note devices over the past two years. To at least somewhat alleviate that issue  sync should be activated automatically and login as well as sync status should be visible while surfing (almost) any Wikipedia page / content  not just under Settings.

Review 10: Very Good; But... I don't like to be forced to click every info window inside an article which I want to read (the mobile site expands the info windows by default). The tab management system and interface is not good at all. Worst of all if I add my favorite articles to the Reading lists while I'm logged into my Wiki account  & then sync the account (through the system's Settings)  then log out & reinstall the app  I will loose all of my Readings list items (the list will be emty); which is not the case with the mobile site.",6816,The app crashed as often as twice per minute while exploring a new subject. The read article button no longer shows unless you scroll down the bottom of the preview. Don't bother with India/Pakistan articles. The administrators seem to allow revert-wars on the articles many editors from are even trying to sell their own books.
org.wikipedia,Positive,"Review 1: What would be lovely for the Wikipedia App: A function that enables the reader to click and hold on unknown terms which causes a small window with a short definition sentence or with a translation of foreign or ancient words to pop up immediately within the opened article. So when you work through complicated texts with lots of expert or scientific words you can make your way through it faster and additionally learn quicklier new word meanings within the context of the sentences without having to open extra tabs and switch between them or even miss this learning process due to lazyness of atcually doing this uncomfortable extra research. The """"immediate word definition pop up window"""" would accelerate and make this research process mkre comfortable as well as increasing knowledge connectivity effects! As a database for short definitions/translation of latin etc terms common dictionary content could be used

Review 2: This is a great app  but for one rather annoying problem! Every time I have to log out [or am logged out by the system] When I log back in  I loose the research lists I've compiled. For me  Wikipedia is a massively useful resource for research  and I support it whenever I can financially. However  the ability to have a seamless interface that functions across all platforms is how this goes to the next level! Sadly this isn't quite quite yet! Web based functionality isn't on par with the app  so can't go from one to the other. Still a biliever though ☺️ and always will be. One of the greatest resources man kind had ever crated!

Review 5: I could easily live without google  but NEVER without Wikipedia! And now I can access it anywhere  anytime! Tabbed interface is very useful. Saving feature is also nice to access some pages when offline; perhaps it could be even better if that feature would be linked to the account so I could have the same pages across devices or get back on clean reinstall. There is also problem with fonts missing some diacritic letters (e.g. Indian languages - Sanskrit  Pali etc.) EDIT: smthg wrong with this ver  can't get the left menu nor find history and settings a/w else!

Review 6: No toolbar on the bottom please The version before this one was great. Android has an overflow button and the hamburger menu and it worked great for wikipedia. The app was beautiful and stayed out of the way. Now I feel like the design is parting ways with the Android design language but  most importantly  I feel like I lost screen real estate. What's more  the implementation is not the greatest  and as such the bar doesn't disappear fully and/or directly. Please reconsider this design decision. Other than that  thanks for everyting

Review 7: First read this description The official Wikipedia Android app is designed to help you find  discover  and explore knowledge on Wikipedia. Settle a bet with a friend by doing a quick search through the app  or dive into featured articles  images  recommended articles  and more using the explore feed. With more than 39 million articles in nearly 300 languages  your favorite free online encyclopedia is now at your fingertips. Features: Explore feed - The new ‘explore feed’ offers recommended and constantly updating Wikipedia content r

Review 8: One of the best apps I like this app because there's so much information and knowledge that you can get from it. I use Wikipedia often for research when I whenever I write a movie or a screenplay. If you're going to write a movie about any subject that's always good to do lots and lots of research that way it'll help tell your story in a way that you wanted to so I highly recommend this app to all those who may or may not be storytellers or those who just want to know some history so I definitely recommend this app.

Review 9: Simply the best Both in its design and content  not to mention accessibility and ease of use  one of the truly original and premier ideas to have arisen within the Internet. Holding all of it's authors accountable  while at the same time pointing out where further proof is needed or required  or where further information is needed  gives it unmatched credibility while demanding facts and not opinions. A true internet original  this app has something for everyone.

Review 10: My best friend! Wikipedia is my go-to app when I need information. I used to use Google  but that's become a storage-gobbling piece of garbage which I don't need in order to organise my life. Every Google update is a waste of space and data  but every update of this little beauty just improves it even more! Better still  the developers don't come  cap in hand  begging for money... unlike some! I cannot recommend this highly (or loudly) enough.

org.wordpress.android,Negative,"Review 1: This app is so bright it hurts. You're trying to read  write and relax  but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing. This app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example  instead all we get is the """"""""""""""""discover"""""""""""""""" feature which only promotes bland  vague and uninteresting posts with no personality. Just look at it right now! Where are the people sharing relatable stories  or video game strategies  or book or tv show reviews or something? All the posts featured there are just... unattractive  to say the least. And it's the only source of new content there is  otherwise you have to look it up manually. There are no set categories or tags  instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they won't see your post  which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers. People can disapprove or even edit your comments. That is twisted  discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want. You can't dislike posts or comments  so the voting system is pointless. You might think otherwise because Twitter and Vine have no downvotes  but they promote discovery of new content in various ways  while WordPress does not. The search bar doesn't work. I've tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they don't appear. All of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community  and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on WordPress. Also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images; a necessity when the background is white.""""

Review 2: What happened to the full editor??!!! Went to create a blog post today using my WordPress app and discovered that the editor is some weird  useless version of what it was before. I can't do anything in it like I can in the web based editor such as indent  center  size/place images  etc....literally every major function but basic typing is gone. Where did it go and how do I get it back? If this is not fixed I am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor. As well  the web based editor crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I do an update to a blog. Makes editing virtually impossible. - - - I received an automated response to this review which said  """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""You can switch back to the app's old editor: Go to App Settings in the app and toggle off the 'Show Visual Editor' option. However  some of the features you mentioned (such as indenting or aligning text) weren't part of the old editor  either."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" - - - Found the setting. That leaves ONLY the HTML editor and does not fix the problem...at all. And  previously  before this change  the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features.""""

Review 3: Does not work with several popular comment subscription plugins. If a blog has comment moderation enabled  and then an administrator replies to (and thereby approves) a comment which is """"pending moderation"""" from within this app  the comment author will never get the reply notification email. This is because this app appears to somehow bypass the `wp_set_comment_status` hook when administrators reply to a """"pending moderation"""" comment within the app. The `wp_set_comment_status` hook is what fires the reply notification emails for many comment subscription plugins. There is a clue that the developers know of this bug (I do see it as a bug) because  in this app  an administrator can """"Reply"""" to comment that is pending moderation  but in the regular WP Admin interface  the button is labeled """"Approve and Reply"""" not just """"Reply."""" I hope this gets fixed as it would be great to use this app to approve and reply to comments  and fire the `wp_set_comment_status` hook so that comment authors can receive email notification of the replies.

Review 4: Hard work This app is ok. The end results can be great if you are patient  but the whole interface is just painful  and I end up putting off updating my blog because I know it is going to be a hassle. There seem to be so many different areas to the app  all of which allow you to edit a post for example  but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options. Yesterday I was previewing a post  found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor  which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first. And now I can't find it. Could be great but is too messy and bitty. Typical piece of software written by a large company with lots of developers who don't talk to each other  and no one person with an overview of what it is really like to use.

Review 5: I'm having an issue with """"WordPress"""" which I thought was addressed in the latest update to the app (apparently it's not). My wordpress blog provides rss feeds to my app. Whenever I post an article that contains an image on WordPress  the image appears twice on the corresponding article in my app. On WordPress  the article looks good  with one image  but on my app  the article looks bad with the same image appearing twice on the same article. The problem is probably with the WordPress rss feed which is duplicating my articles images. It wasn't like this before. I only have this problem with WordPress rss feeds. And It has almost made me abandon WordPress completely for other available alternatives. I would like the Wordpress developer team to investigate and help resolve this issue  or I might have to abandon WordPress for good.

Review 6: I'm mad. Furious. I've been using the WP app for 4.3 years  5 days a week  that's over 1 000 posts. I think I'm pretty experienced in WP. I was a bit peeved that the signature option went away  but got over it. HOWEVER.... Now you took away the upload photo size?!? 😡😠 What the hell were you thinking? 'Image optimizer'? At 3000x3000? My theme ends at 720px  why would I need any bigger? Now I must edit each one  delaying my posts from posting  my upload time is longer by having to upload larger files and usually has many local saves  due to the internet being taxed by large files in which also fills my media space Gaaaa! I even noticed the multi pix upload is gone. Lucky  I don't upload that way. Just tell me who I have to come over there and slap. Seriously. Please put it back in next update. For heaven sake  man.

Review 7: I don't like this update  because  I am use wordpress apps on mobile i click theme customizer but it's pop up to other browser to login and edite theme  but i can't login everytime every hour  every month  I am use my current login detail  but it's can't login anymore  I want back to edite theme with wordpress apps  And i want to use 2G network to use surf on wordpress  Please fix this my problem. And onething we(my friends and me) want to say is """"when we click theme customizer in wordpress mobile apps before this version  it's pop up to login page we insert our login detail but it's doesn't matter  I hate this problem and today current version update.. Please allow and care me to my request and complain. Thank you.

Review 8: Photo uploading is decidedly broken. The multi picker works great  but it is a coin toss whether each individual photo will upload successfully or hang at 80% and go nowhere. The only way to fix hung uploads is to delete it and then browse through your photos again to try once more. This is a huge burden when you upload 20 photos and 5 of them hang. This behavior is consistent whether on wifi or data. What's more  the only intuitive options for a poat are """"local draft"""" or """"publish"""". I can't get the app to default to """"draft""""  in which it is uploaded and able to be edited on my computer. Even if I only have the app as a way to upload cell photos  it is almost worthless at that.

Review 9: terrible aside from the awesome layouts and ability to have a blog for free  the app itself is killing me. like seriously  i have to try to log on a million times before the app will recognize my account or even let me into my account. especially after i had to reset my password a bunch of times in order to actually get the stupid thing to let me in. what is the sense of having an app to access my blog on my tablet or cell phone  when i cant get into it even when i am entering the correct information? it shows the login screen and i enter the info  then it goes through and there is another login to fill in  and it happens over and over again. what is wrong with it! please fix it!

Review 10: Good app overall  with one annoying bug. In some instances  editing in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""webpage"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" view mode (as opposed to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""html"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""") will alter the code -- even if you don't change anything and immediately toggle to """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""html."""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Making """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""html"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the default view should be a workaround  but as it is  I have to save my script in a 3rd party app and re-paste it in if I want to make any changes since my script is immediately ruined the instant it opens in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""webpage"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" view -- which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a webpage editor in the first place.""""",9389,The app doesn't have some sort of front page like imgur has for example.

org.wordpress.android,Positive,"Review 1: Great and easy but where is the kitchen sink? I like my text to be aligned as justify and there are no text alignment options I can see. I can't publish posts from my phone without having to go on desktop and justify text first. It's a pain. As is uploading images to a post. But for rough drafts  this thing has changed the way I blog. Please fix missing features or just direct me to them if I've missed them! Thanks! **EDIT** Thank you for responding. Of course! I should have thought of that. It's not as easy as the kitchen sink but it'll do!

Review 2: Easy to get started with great options- I really like this app because it allows me to edit posts when off line  putting changes through when logged into a network. However  it seems to not keep in sync with work done on my desk top. Logged into my desk top or portable device will get me different results  even though both should be synced  that shouldn't matter  right-of both devices go on line and are edited on the same account? I'm pretty sure that I've been saving my changes. Anyhow  thank you for this application. I like the themes.

Review 3: Excellent customer support but app could definitely use some work. I recently had an issue but they helped me fix the it. I do have one request for the developers. It would be nice if I could edit my posts in more of a WYSIWYG way like on the website. Right now I have to edit the HTML to make changes which can be useful  but many times more of a hassle. It's also not user friendly for anyone who doesn't know HTML5. If you could add a visual mode to the app it would be useful. The in-app support chat is excellent though.

Review 4: Good App But... Thanks to the developer for the response  looking forward to an update with my requested features in the near future. I manage multiple wordpress blogs(more than 50). My blogs serve as rss feeds for my mobile apps. so it's quite challenging remembering passwords to login and then logout for each of them. A multi-login WordPress app will be very useful in handling this issue  as all I'll have to do is sign-in once to each of them and then just switch users when I need to manage another blog. Thank you.

Review 5: New to blogs  I've had my blog for almost 3 years and the procedure for publishing be posts: is a simple as using a word processor. For the first time blogger this is a great choice. It allows you to move on to a full sites once you reached levels that advertisers want toput ads on your site on your blog. But there are limitations wifi free version including not being able to post videos  so getting news followers is more difficult. Persevere and you might even get paid. Upgrade is $99   I think pretty steep.

Review 6: Used to love it I am not sure what happened. On Thursday  this app was amazing. I used it to do work when I was on the road  updating different things on the dashboard from my app. No joke  I loved this app. I manage 5 sites through it. I went to Canada and came back to the states this morning  and now I have to go through the Internet to access the dashboard which means I have to log in every time too. Ugh. This is terrible for someone like me who does web page admin on the go. Big fail  wordpress.

Review 7: The reader I mentioned the reader I meant I'm not able to view my site in-app. I like using this app even when there's issues but I'd love it if the reader returns. I do like the addition of searching for posts via keywords & hope that stays. An improvement would be if the posts related to the keyword(s) weren't in random order by date. Also  I've noticed when I try to visit self-hosted sites it goes to their blog in-app it'd be nice if they were available to view in reader.

Review 8: OK  but drafts vs posts (19 Nov  2016) Here Samsung J5  Android 6.0.1. I've been using this app for almost 2 years now. I like the design  although a bit 'messy' at times  I still can't view drafts separately from published posts! In iOS it is possible to select posts that are only 'published'  'drafts' or 'scheduled' from a scroll-down menu ... Or is it just me? It makes editing so much easier  especially drafts that have been around for quite some time! Thank you  anyway.

Review 9: Good tool For the most part  I enjoy managing my blog with the app alone. There are some features unique to the web version  which I definitely understand. However  with the latest update  posts in the reader do not appear to be in chronological order with the blogs I follow  and there doesn't seem to be a way to sort posts. The first couple are recent  then there's some from a week ago  and then more recent. Good app overall  but this feature is quite frustrating.

Review 10: I love using the app vs having to use a pc or tablet all the time. The only trouble I am having is figuring how to change on the app from blog I created for an organization to another blog I have created for a different organization. Any help would be appreciated. Do I simply sign out and open under the second one which has a different name  email and password? When I went to sign out on the app to ion another blog it was saying I would lose some things.

org.xbmc.kore,Negative,"Review 1: I'm extremely disappointed with this app and will be uninstalling it. I was extremely excited to see that there was a remote app for Kodi since the controls they have are very limited and in order to 'rewind' or 'fast forward' you have to swype the screen and it takes you to predetermined spots  making it difficult to find the exact spot you want. Maybe it's just my ignorance and laziness  but I assumed that this was a remote that would work on the Kodi app and not an entirely different app that ran Kodi on it. I only use Kodi to strem TV and movies via 3rd party add on's and for whatever reason this app doesn't allow me to use the add on's. I'm extremely disappointed (since I was sooo excited about having a remote for Kodi) and really annoyed that I wasted time setting it up.

Review 2: App works great but can't set up any new devices because test connection always fails even on devices that work. (I backup my settings and copy them to new phones/tablets such as my gfs to get my existing Kodi installations working on new control devices but as the app is I can't set up any new ones in Kore). So as it is now it's pretty useless when I move my devices to new networks because the ip changes and I can't save the new settings in Kore. Fix that and it's 5 stars again. Send text to device doesn't work at all. Should be fixed or the option removed from Kore. Thanks.

Review 3: Annoying bug  but not app breaking Overall  a good app. The issue is the power button/control. It will turn kodi off when pressed once  but then get stuck on starting kodi as kodi wont start. It is like the power on feature  if it is able to turn kodi off  is either missing or broken. App has already been reinstalled and can pick up the media server  so its not settings wise on kodi due to being able to connect. Kodi also runs fine by itself  thus isolating it to the app. Whatever bug this is please fix so people can easily start kodi.

Review 4: Two irritating features 1. When I have it set to show notifications in status bar so I can pop back into it at a moment's notice.... That feature only works for one file at a time. If the next episode plays automatically  the icon in notifications disappears until I go in  uncheck  then recheck it. 2. It doesn't pull strm files from Kodi for upnp content. If I'm streaming a show from Hulu for example  pseudolibrary will generate a strm so I can see all the metadata in kodi. In kore...I only see metadata from local content only.

Review 5: No gesture region makes it useless! It's beautiful  but the lack of a gesture region  for which every other Kodi remote I've used has  makes it awkward to use. Do you look down at a traditional remote to find what button to press? No  you can feel where the keys are. There is obviously no tactile feedback on a touchscreen  which is why a gesture region should be MANDATORY; It's the next best thing  if not better  than tactile feedback. Having to look down at the remote to find the button to press is just flat out ridiculous.

Review 6: POC Good concept  doesn't do 80% of what I want. Not very configurable. Generic design. No tab  skip or mute button. No indication of whether the program has crashed or you're simply experiencing network delay. No indication on device of a volume change. No volume change is possible with the rocker buttons unless you're actually on the remote screen  and the phone is on. Unreliable in the event that you suddenly need to pause or mute the video. May work well for specific use cases  but mine is not one of them.

Review 7: Made my computer crash It made Kodi crash which was fine. My computer went back to the home screen then my computer randomly shut off. I couldn't boot back in to my computer  which I've had this issue before. Luckily this time I was able to boot in to verbose mode and easily fix it even though it was a pain. I know for sure it was this app though because of the messages in verbose mode. How can a remote control app cause a computer to crash like that...hmmmm??? Also the queue function did not work for me.

Review 8: The tightly mixed 3x3 navigation button makes me constantly having to look down at the damn handheld device to use my most frequent keys  the arrows (like for navigating). The OK button in the middle with the much less used corner 4 buttons all get in the way. PLEASE SEPARATE. MAKE THE ARROWS A LAYOUT SET WITH THE OK AND CORNERS KEYS AWAY ON A SECOND LAYOUT SET. I would like to be able to use kore without ALWAYS looking down to ensure i down accidently press Ok or corner 4 buttons.

Review 9: Connecting issues The app is perfect the only issue is when shut down the raspberry and then restart it the app just try to connect to it. The problem is that the raspberry changes its ip and the app can't find it. A solution it came to my mind is that the app don't search the raspberry with its ip but with its name. The only bad thing with this is that someone may have to raspberry with the same name but this is his problem. Sorry for my bad English. I wish I helped.

Review 10: Shows promise  not ready yet. Couldn't see files on a usb disk easily (udisk0 not visible). Had to manually add music source /storage/udisk0/ to see any files in a directory structure. Files are rearranged in alphabetical order - the track order number prefix in the filename has been lost. What I am trying to do is play audio with remote only - no screen.

I downloaded Yates before this app and In have chosen this app over Yates and all others  this app has alot of great functions  I only with it could open up Kodi from main menu. uninstalling""""

Review 2: I used the old XBMC Remote for a long time and thought I would look for a better one. Maybe one has a mute button for streams that have commercials? This is it!! The more I use Kore the more awesome functionality I find. It's like a surprise with every swipe. I'm at a loss to find any drawbacks here... Amazingly simple interface  very intuitive  graphics of music play on the home screen in a neat little box  totally cool. For me though... loving the mute button!!! I'm still stunned every time I use Kore my new remote for KODI Rock the house!

Review 3: Amazing companion to Kodi Kodi already has icing on the cake  so where does that leave Kore? Double icing baby. The ease of use and features make this a must-have when using Kodi. Make playlists  browse your library  check descriptions and cast  adjust addons  all from within the app without interrupting your video viewing pleasure. Isn't open development great? UPDATE: the seek function must have disappeared during an update. Essential function for watching video  so down from 5 stars to 2. And also switched to Yatse. Bye Kore

Review 4: Great app! The app is absolutely fantastic  especially when used with Kodibuntu on a computer with Ethernet. Works like a dream  would recommend to anyone willing to modernise their home entertainment center. All you need is an older PC and Kodibuntu and you're all set. Just two things I'd love to see in the app though: the ability to set the shutdown timer in the app itself and that when you select a song in the app it starts playing the album from there  not just the song and then it stops. Other than that: superb.

Review 5: Works  but lacks some functionality Interface is clean and uncluttered  quite intuituve. However  1: no apparent support for multiple media centers if not configured immediately - app will keep searching for initial configuration and requires a data clear to add another media center  2: unlike XBMC remote  filenames truncated even on landscape view so difficult to choose episodes or movies with long names. Fix these minor issues  five stars. And thanks to the XBMC/Kodi team for all the good work.

Review 6: I tried Yatse and didn't care for the size of the app or all the hidden settings. Not to mention the developer is rude as all get out. This """"""""""""""""official"""""""""""""""" remote is more than capable to meet my needs. I can navigate and play content with ease. For those complaining about missing text input  hit the properties/settings button. It's the """"""""""""""""Send text to media center"""""""""""""""" option. You're welcome. One thing I would love to see implemented is Android Wear support.""""

Review 7: Great App but more options needed This is an excellent remote for all your Kodi devices and very convenient. Also it has a nice Material design. For 5 stars however some things are missing. For example I would like to display the path of an library entry on its details page. I wish it had more options to control all the things kodi can do without navigating with the standard navigation pad. \*Update also a widget and persistent notification /w controls during playback.

Review 8: Works great once its set up. 1 problem. If the IP address changes or I try to use this on my other system. There is no option to delete the current settings in order to set it up again without going back to the program settings and delete the cashe file. It would be great if you guys could put an option in to either toggle between multiple IP addresses or at least have the ability to delete the current settings so that it can be setup to a new one.

Review 9: Great remote G-BOX MX2 w/xbmc Very fast and responsive. Once it is setup and you discover what all the icons are for Kore is an excellent way to control XBMC. My favorite feature is when I plug in my external hdd full of movies and TV shows and press menu the set content it shows up in Kore organized with all of the album art automatically. The only way to make this remote better would be to add a touch mouse pad with better keyboard input.

Review 10: Very well done  with a few gaps The best HTPC software just deserved a remote like this. Very robust  intuitive  feature rich  and not nearly as buggy as Yatse. It is quite disappointing  though  that  after all these years  the remote still doesn't have the ability to start Kodi; it's like having a TV remote without a power button. A nice addition would be to be able to operate with plug-ins  something other remotes are able to do.",5082,Kore is an excellent remote for all your Kodi devices and very convenient.

org.yaaic,Negative,"Review 1: Some issues.... No ignore feature. Autocompletion won't work capitalized  and speaking of  most phones nowadays do not have a search key to use the autocomplete feature. Search keys are so 2009 so please fix that? And I agree the auto scroll down when someone posts is annoying but I suppose this was an attempt to fix the old issue of the box getting stuck on old lines so it appears there is no conversation occurring? Good client otherwise just needs some final brushing at this point.

Review 2: Missing some key things: SASL identification doesn't work. Close button and /part seem to do nothing. A button for nick auto-completion  like AndChat has  would be good. Also  a minor thing  but I should still be able to /join channels  despite there being a button to do this. Some /list functionality would be great; right now  this command crashes the app. Otherwise  a well designed client. Easier to use than others  without sacrificing features.

Review 3: hard to evaluate this works reliably enough for what it CAN do  but functionality wise it's incapable of doing what I actually need it for. After getting a search result from a bot  it's not possible to select within the text received in order to copy and paste it in channel  which renders it pretty much useless to me :(

Review 4: some scandinavian characters do not work Very good. Only problem is that scandinavian characters (öäå) are not displayed correctly. Character set is UTF-8 and if someone is writing with different character set  characters are not displayed right. Maybe it's possible to make some conversion table?

Review 5: Now broken. I used to use Yaairc a lot  now it repeatedly loses connection on all my servers. Other users are saying this is an SSL bug  which is possible (all my servers use SSL). Otherwise  it's a lightweight  no nonsense client that does what you expect.

Review 6: Basics work  not updated anymore? The basics work great  however a few features are still needed (see other comments). Since the last update happened two years ago I slightly doubt we will see one in the near future

Review 7: Good UI update but.. Keyboard Enter key bug still not fixed. Please do fix it. I stopped using this app because of that (and the lack of / commands support). Otherwise awesome app!

Review 8: /msg does not work I love this app. I'd give if five stars if /msg worked. No window spawned or message sent to the other user. /msg commands just vanish in this client.

Review 9: White colorized names Would be nice if white was not a possible color for names to be colorized with. Since the text is already white it makes it hard to read.

Review 2: Works great I downloaded a different IRC android app before downloading this one  but every 2 minutes I would be ping'd out no matter what my settings were. This one is quick and easy  but not a lot of options to toy around with like logs and color edit (while chatting  I could care less about the bg color  it's already black the way I like it). I also love the fact that even when I'm kicked out  I can see the last conversation when I rejoin.

Review 3: Nearly perfect This is a fantastic IRC chat app. Clean and thoughtfully-designed user interface that is intuitive and doesn't get in your way  and supports just about all the features I use. Only thing I wish it had was the ability to automatically select from among multiple servers and ports (mainly because some FreeNode servers don't work on my employer's firewalled WiFi network).

Review 4: Works great I want to be able see the room list for the server I'm on and be able to change the noise for the alerts instead of there only being an option to turn on sound. It would be nice to also be able to set the alert option per room or from specific senders instead of globally. I would have rated much higher if not for several nuances that I wish it had.

Review 5: The best Android irc client Yaaic has all the essential features I need in an irc client. It is easy to set up and the automatic identification of your nic works. The UI has a neat and simple design which is intuitive and which presents multiple channels well on small screens. It is also open source.

Review 6: Good  but... Perfect  apart from one thing: it sometimes lags when trying to join a channel on an SSL enabled server. I'm not sure if this is just an issue with SSL servers only as I only use the app for one server. Which uses SSL. That said  this is otherwise hands down the best Android IRC app.

Review 7: One of the better irc clients for Android I think this is a decent android irc app. Has most of the """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""must have"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" features.

Review 8: Freezes up and crashes Program works good. Had no issues on my Galaxy S4  but now I am on a HTC One M9 and it works okay with the exception that it crashes after you return from not using it for a little bit. Would gladly say 5 stars if you can patch or. :)

Review 9: Big Servers ANDChat and Yaaic are the only clients that don't crash on channels with a very large population; like MMO servers. It may lack some features  but I love the simple UI and how fast it runs on my phone.

Review 10: Clean Nice and clean. I like the black background. The only thing missing is start at boot and autoconnect.

Review 2: Best xmpp client Xabber slows and crashes a lot on my tablet. This client is solid. Only supports one xmpp account  though. But how many do you really need? Those tcp connections eat battery  after all.

Review 3: only one XMPP account small  tiny and good looking  but supports only one XMPP account and that's too few in times of gTalk and FB (being not proper Jabber servers)  so I switched to Xabber

Review 4: Love it Nice and simple client no bloaty features. Would like if it had settings for keep-alive though since there's some servers I connect to that don't always play nice with the client.

Review 5: Loving this lightweight beauty so far... ... the only thing it's lacking (for me) is an option to run at boot-up... but there are work-arounds. I'm patient. Thanks developers.

I contacted the developer  but he's no longer working on this project. Will use again we can answer the riddle """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""What is a timer that doesn't keep time?""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Review 2: Not reliable The timer is a great concept  but the timer is not consistent with the gong/bell tone after the countdown has finished. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. Please fix this bug. I use it for yoga and I stay in a posture and after some time I realise the countdown had finished but there was no alarm.

Review 3: HTC phone seems to stop app from working when in hibernation no matter what priority setting selected. Works well in Samsung tablet initially but now having issue. Bye bye Bodhi Timer. You were once good but now ruined by impermanence...

Review 4: Often doesn't play sound on finishing countdown I have double checked everything in the settings  but nonetheless sometimes works and others not. This leaves me wondering whether I've finished a sitting  interfering with concentration.

Review 5: Sucks Auto repeat just stopped after 3 repeats. It should not stop until I tell it to. Auto repeat doesn't work at all in advanced mode. Could not figure out how to change advanced mode settings. Got frustrated & uninstalling.

Review 6: Ever since I've upgraded my phone  I can't get the same sounds I used to get  and sometimes  the timer doesn't even work. I am uninstalling the app!

What I would still love to see is the possibility to pre-define more than one multiple timer (maybe a second row  even though I can see the difficulty to display the length of each period for distinguishing between more of them) Additionally  an option to prevent the device from rotating  e.g. forcing the app into portrait mode  would be great.

Review 2: Simple  beautiful. No permissions  doesn't try to sell me anything.Esthetically pleasing and it does just what it says it does and nothing else. Thank you for this lovely app. For those of you who are having trouble getting it to work properly  with the Android 6.0 update  you now control more permissions. On the app  go into settings  (the 3 little dots in the upper right hand corner)  and scroll down until you get to 'stay awake'. Click the box next to it and that will keep your phone from going to sleep while using. 😃

Review 3: Simple  customizable  and effective This app is the best meditation timer I've used. The UI isn't perfect  but the chimes are customizable and free. I like hearing three chimes at the end of my sittings and this makes that easy to set up. You can set a visual representation for time remaining that's a nice caligraphic circle. It doesn't have any social networking features  which was also a plus for me.

Review 4: Fantastic Very simple but very effective. No ads  no nonsense  nothing but a countdown timer with a nice sound. My favorite bit is you don't need to switch it off or anything when it's done  you just meditate  it makes a nice bell sound and you're finished.

Review 5: no personal information required ? this app requires no account creation  no personal information  no email address  and no hooks into your google or facebook account. what a nice surprise ! and it works very simply and elegantly  i must add

ro.weednet.contactssync,Negative,"Review 1: battery drain  lag I have the same problem as others. I have used this app ever since i bout my phone (over 8 months ago) and recently my contacts app is slow to load and will only load 30 contacts. But give it about a whole minute and the rest will load. Messaging app will only show phone numbers and not the contact name. But give it a whole minute and it will. And the phone call log is slow as well. Battery drain problem as well. Android Core Apps is what it says is draining it now. Cleared cache... did nothing. Factory reset my phone.... did nothing. Updated my phone... did nothing. Finally Samsung had me put the phone in safe mode which keeps only the pre-loaded apps on it running. It works fine. Which tells me it is a problem with a downloaded app. This app is the only app i have that deals with the contacts and i will be deleting it to see if that solves my problem. I am betting it does. Too bad.... this was a great app while it lasted.

Review 2: EDIT - Battery Drain EDIT: Latest update (v2.2) has fixed the battery drain issue for the Nexus 5. Worked great for a while  but a recent bug has completely broken the app for at least the Nexus 5. Started draining battery and permanently saying """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Sync waiting for other processes"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". Won't even sync contacts anymore for me. Battery drain shows up as Android Core Apps. Can't guarantee it's related to this app  but the dialer also hangs for ~20 seconds before placing calls. Hope it gets fixed soon as it worked great before this bug.""""

Review 3: Was an awesome app b4 fb api change Now the app is useless like many others but I still will not nor ever download the fb native app until they actually make it work better than using the browser. I think we should start a class action against fb. Only reason they changed the api is so that we as users would have to log into our accounts to do anything and hence falsely increase their user stats for ad revenue like how many ads am I really going to see if I log in just to check friend bdays for the day in notifications instead of using an app

Review 4: USELESS APP I tried it in attempt to counteract the Facebook sync issue  which Google's security update has created in all devices which run the latest systems. I found that even with this app installed  I still had to open my Facebook app and go to the menu  scroll down to app settings  scroll down to the sync settings at the bottom and tap the SYNC ALL option and tap SYNC at the top right corner of the page every single time I powered up or rebooted my phone. No help.

Review 5: Permission Buzzkill What? You have to send a permission request to every FB friend to ask them to authorize a 3rd party app to grab their public info?!? Hmmm... Instead let me call them on Sunday morning and tell them I'm giving their cell # to every telemarketer who calls me. Won't be my friend for long. You may have gotten the shaft by FB on this  but you should add that in your app description. Shame. ***Please remove my information - I have uninstalled***

Review 6: No status info I can't see anything to indicate that this app is doing anything when I hit sync. Screen going to sleep seems to stop the app  meaning I must set my phone to a 30 minute screen timer so this app can work. But is it working? No status bar or notification - app just states at me  and i guess i just have to check my contacts to see if it did anything. Kinda weird and a big omission that almost every other beginner's app includes.

Review 7: Battery drain AND FB access token violation! I'm pretty sure Ubersync just caused me to get blocked from liking any posts or pages on FB for 3 days. I received a warning that a 3rd party was using my access token  and had to check a box saying I understand giving out my access token could get me permanently banned. I have 2200+ FB friends and was trying to sync all contacts. Fix this please. Also  the battery drain is huge.

Review 8: Battery Drain and Lag Not sure what happened  but the last update has made this unusable. My S4 was experiencing seriously bad lag. FB and Contacts kept freezing and had to force close all the time. Battery life went down to about 4 hours off a fresh charge. I did a factory reset not knowing the problem and it didn't help. I finally traced it down to this app. Uninstalled and my phone runs like new again.

Review 9: Almost Since I uninstalled and reinstalled facebook I lost all my contacts  and since facebook no longer allows you to sync contacts to your phone I downloaded this. It works  but it can only sync facebook friends that already use this app. (So for me  just 2 contacts) I have roughly 500 facebook friends  so this isn't very helpful to me  as convincing everyone I know to use this app isn't very feasible.

Review 10: Used to work Been wondering why my battery life has gone way down and why my phone keeps randomly lagging then I realized that none of my contact photos are there as well as half the time my dialer is just a blank screen. Put 2 and 2 together and figured its this app. Sucks that the Dev hasn't fixed it yet when it seems that people have been complaining about the same problems for about a week now.....",5217,The app is slow to load and will only load 30 contacts. The phone call log is slow as well. The dialer also hangs for ~20 seconds before placing calls. Battery drain shows up as Android Core Apps. No status bar or notification - app just states at me.
ro.weednet.contactssync,Positive,"Review 1: Just what I was looking for!!! This App not only links your contacts to their Facebook profile/picture  but it ALSO let's you EASILY """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Join"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" the contacts you choose  so if you have any multiplies or your contacts use a different name  or have a different name on Facebook than what you refer to them as; eg. """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Mom"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" in your phone  but """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Jane Doe"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" on Facebook; you can just select 'Join' in the contact editor  than select their FB account(s)  and you're done! It's THAT SIMPLE!!!! ...I REALLY LOVE this App  and think it's a MUST for ALL!!!!""""

Review 2: Heavensent! LOL Now  I agree that it could be a little more explicit in demonstrating that it's syncing  maybe like show the progress in an easier way? Otherwise  I couldn't be happier  I don't understand why Facebook and Android stopped working together  like apparently Facebook only works well on iPhones respective of syncing friends profile pictures with the Contacts app on my Moto Maxx. Thank you so much for this app that actually works quite amazingly well :)

Review 3: Great but needs material design I wanted to emulate the behavior of the way Windows Phone handles contacts  most importantly showing contacts' Facebook pictures. This app works pretty much the same  and better because you can go straight to a contact's Facebook timeline (deep linked in the Facebook app) from a button that this app adds to the contact's page in the Contacts app. Only thing it's missing is material design  especially for the ubersync icon.

Review 4: Motorola Moto G Xt1031 4.4 Kit Kat With my phone being a Google phone it does not support syncing contacts with Facebook contacts. & If I am correct Google has maybe since the 4.2 or 4.3 update..Why not now? Well Thank-you  UBER-SYNC  this app has definitely helped!! So for anyone with the same problem I would suggest trying this App..& keeping in mind it may work differently with different phones I think it's definitely worth a try...

Review 5: Back to being good. Edit: Ads are back. Not so intrusive  but there. Original: After trying all the other options  I am back to this as the best sync option we have and now that the junk-ware episode is in the past  I can comfortably run and endorse it. The need for a more user friendly/clear way to handle non obvious matches would be my caveat on my 5 star rating. The rating is because it works as advertised without advertising ;-)

Review 6: Excellent app Does exactly what it says. Had been looking for some tweak to sync FB dp's with my phone contacts ever since i changed my HTC phone (which has this feature built-in  not nearly as effective as this one though). Have been using this app for a little while now and have encountered no issues so far. Totally love the fullscreen HD pics showing up on the caller id screen. Keep up the good work!

Review 7: Great Brilliant app. Would just like to request a way to manually add FB contacts for inclusion so that I can then Join them in contacts on my phone. I have Google and Facebook contacts that don't have the same name on both. I know I can do it if I sync all contacts and then Join or I change the contact name on my phone but would be nice to have a way to do it from within the app

Review 8: Great app Worked really well and made my contact list look a lot better... until Facebook broke it  that is. For those seeking an alternative: I suggest Identiconizer. It's not pictures  but it's better than the default icons. It generates blocky patterns based on the contact's name. I installed it via F-Droid  but it's probably available in the Play store  too.

Review 9: Finally a solution that works I swapped to a new phone and lost my contacts in the process. They showed up in Facebook & messenger but not in people/contacts. I tried everything  and the settings were all correct  but Facebook and Google don't want to play nice together. This app fixed me  and all my missing Facebook contacts are back. Thanks!

Review 10: Great app Great app but needs to be able to sync only pictures. I don't care about status updates. Would like sync settings to have a time limit to be ran and frequency. Say 2am every night so I know my phone will be updated each morning when I unplug it from the charger and won't drain my battery using wifi and unplugged.",4370,"The app links your contacts to their Facebook profile/picture.

Review 7: Bunch of fools commenting If you don't know how to use it  stop commenting!. Basically you want to save a picture from Facebook you use save external  select this application and save to wherever you want. If it doesn't let you save on your SD card you need to root and use sd fixer. So stop commenting worthless trash about the app. I've used it for over a year.

Review 4: Appears to work very well. I've only been using this for about an hour  but it worked consistently  and well.

simple.reboot.com,Positive,"Review 1: Simple boot ( with a big giant Woody) Really is a nice interface and you've covered all the bases. I have had this for a while but today after a hard wipe & a total reset I had configured all 6 pages with apps and all of a sudden this morning Google wants to optimize 211 apps. I lost two-thirds of my icons & and I thought I lost all my apps but one soft reboot & it's all good. S4 I9500 (rooted). Much thanks!

Review 2: Truth be told Truth be told. I didn't need this at all but boy was I wrong. This app enlightened me and I realized the hidden feature within this app. I proceeded to rate this masterpiece a 5 star rating to unlock its hidden feature. The penis enlarger. I know am over 10 inches thick and length. I am a juggernaut. I slay every woman with my trusty steed of a penis  who stands upon my way. Thank you Franco.

Review 3: New version is queer I don't hate this new version  I just think that the old  full-screen one with the tinted status bar and gray theme was better looking. Regardless  this is still by far the best application of its kind on the Play Store  and the only one to incorporate Material Design. Could we possibly have a toggle to switch between the new look and the old full-screen mode?

Review 4: The Best I've Used At What It Does Even includes an option to reboot into safe mode  along with just about every other reboot option one could want. The UI is plain  but looks fine. Small complaint: the developer has his name above any of the options  which is sorta annoying to me (should be at the end). But the app is free...no ads  or unnecessary permissions required. 5 stars.

Review 5: power button add a power button please  i used to add it as a double tap gesture when i used greenify - hibernate +lock screen  but now as use your servicely app i mis that handy feature of double tap to lock  as double tap to unlock is already in my one plus one i find it really useful to double tap to lock and unlock phone

Review 6: Much love! Much great Much love! So great. I just don't understand why my phone didn't turn into a cyborg police officer Butler. And it kind of makes my power button feel lonely. UPDATE:;;"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" WATCH OUT THIS APP WILL MAKE YOUR POWER BUTTON JEALOUS  PSYCHOTIC  AND MURDEROUS. ONLY USE UNDER ADULT SUPERSTITION.""""

Review 7: I get honest-to-goodness belly laughs from reading the dev's replies to users' comments. New icon is okay by me because reasons (free  after all!)... Also the actual rebooting bit does work just as advertised — bravo! And let's MRGA! Would grant a sixth star if I could  because reasons and awesome-sauce.

Review 8: Awesome! Best reboot app I've found. Love how it has the soft reboot option! Update: Not sure if this is an app issue or my device or my recovery  but sometimes when rebooting to recovery  it just powers off and then I havento reboot manually. Not that big of a deal  just a nuisance sometimes.

Review 9: Nice This app is great and adds the missing reboot to stock devices. Can we get only a popup with the styling of lollipop like the power off that show when you press the power button but with all the options that this app have?! That would be amazing. Thank you for the fantastic app.

Review 10: Minor issue on Nougat NRD90S. Rebooting with the app is hit-or-miss since flashing this patch to my Nexus 5X. I can usually only do that once before needing to use the hardware buttons. However  this does NOT affect my rating. Keep up the good work :)",3486,The app is free and adds the missing reboot to stock devices.

trikita.obsqr,Negative,"Review 1: Nearly perfect. I have never seen a less cluttered app with this much functionality. It doesn't handle calendar events. Result dialogue disappears if code goes out of view so you're stuffed if code is on a moving object; really needs a hold/pause button on it to keep it til you cancel it. Gets confused if more than one code is in its field of view.

trikita.obsqr,Positive,"Review 1: So simple! Simple design  no extra features  works great  no ridiculous permissions. I scoured the Play store for a qr reader that did one thing - read qr codes  so many of them are jam packed with annoying extras. I searched over at xda and found this app. EXACTLY what I was looking for! Great job!

Review 2: Best FOSS qr reader Works perfect  no issues at all  will read well even when not holding phone steady or when far away. Beyond that it's FOSS which is great. And it has no BS permissions it needs  it only wants access to the camera. Refreshing to see an app without 10 BS permission requests.

Review 3: Honest and efficient Quick  efficient app for reading a QR code with a single touch  no complex interface slowing you down. I have a not-so-usual configuration (Nexus 4 + CM11) that led to some issues (freeze) with the newest version  but the previous one works perfectly every time.

Review 4: Just works  without spying on you I was feeling pretty hopeless dredging through the many QR apps with permission requirements that run off the page. I love the simplicity provided by Obsqr it that respect  as well as its interface.

Review 5: Almost perfect I really like that this app doesn't need many permissions. The only feature I would like to see is the ability to directly open URLs in my browser.

tv.piratemedia.lightcontroler,Negative,"Review 1: Great that there is this app  the native app is terrible. But it has a lot of rough edges; brightness is crazy  when I slide up it increases  at the top it decreases again and sliding down decreases 10% or so and then leaves the lights at 90% brightness. The disco mode cannot be turned off  you need to kill the app to turn this mode off. When I only use 2 zones  I always have 2 times 4 zones in the app  the maximum. Color temp for white zones does not stick  can slide but it jumps back to 0. And the sideways sliding is alsof sliding the pages  I'm fighting this interface. Also had to restart my wifi box  it kinda lost it's way. And I had to kill the native app before using this one. Can't use the app as it is until I'll organize an extremely bright disco party :):) I'm dying to use this without the bugs and I am willing to pay a few bucks for it.

Review 2: Problem on Note 4 I really liked the app and the integration with tasker and wear but since i upgraded to android 5.1.1 the program crashes all the time and i keep receiving notification that this app is making my phone slow and asks for uinstall...please fix this issue

Review 3: Dosent work Works fine the first time i open it. When i close the app an reopen it no matter what I try it wont conect to my easybulb. If i reinstall the app it will conect again untill i close the app and i can kiss it goodbye... terrible

Review 4: Great app but needed more work I'm a bit gutted this hasn't been updated in a while. There are some problems that need to be ironed out. Keeps draining power in Marshmallow and the brightness slider doesn't work correctly.

Review 5: Crashes all the time Nicely designed and has way more features than the official app  but crashes several times per day when in background  beyond what would be tolerable. Uninstalling for now.

tv.piratemedia.lightcontroler,Positive,"Review 1: Very Nice App. Has potential. Easily took control of my Milight  just had to modify the IP address. Could see a few things added to improve it. But overall it's clear  easy & a very nice app. Would like to see these additions: allow widget modifications(select which switches show)  all light controls to show up when entering app - not just control of 1 particular switch  alarm feature added (other apps have this  very neat feature). Also  lock screen controller Doesn't work with Next lock screen (Microsoft app).

Review 2: i think this is definately a step in the right direction  but there are a few features i would love to see implemented. I would like to see a function where if i grt a notification on my phone  it flashes one or all of the lights a pre-determined colour  and also  be able to turn on and off my lights automatically if im connected to the wifi network and determining wether or not its dark outside by using sunrise/sunset information. BTW Im willing to pay for these features! Thanks :)

Review 3: Cool app Thank you for that little magical tool. Precise speed control would be great. Or a tap button where you can input a speed by tapping a button. Color changes just look so !much nicer if they are matched to the beat. I love the widget. A pain if you always have to open the app. More functionality on that widget would be great. Oh and nearly forgot: the brightness fader is quite buggy on my Nexus7 2012

Review 4: Great so far! Would like some features! This is a wonderful app to control my LimitlessLED bulbs. Wish is had better integration with tasker. Would love an alarm mode that simulated a sunrise  maybe a sleep alarm that dims the lights at a certain time as well. Ability to create custom light patterns within the app would also be awesome! Good luck with development  love that you're using material design.

Review 5: Beautiful! Works great and a huge improvement from the terrible official app. Please let users collapse the lower section of the app as I almost never use the disco mode. Display instead some customizable preset color/intensity buttons (long press to save  tap to apply). Not really a fan of the title/action bar changing color (add an option please :)

Review 6: Works well! I can control my milight clones with my watch  very nice. It's looks well designed  although still a bit buggy. When enabled the notifications on my LG G4 (5.1) it stops the phone from turning on in standby  so disabled that. And I don't understand the message in the wifi settings for Wear  do I need to enable or disable it?

Review 7: Awesome! Works exceptionally well with Tasker. I replaced tons of useless code i needed with the other app and replaced it with a few simple commands from this plugin. Very well done. ***** most recent update with wear support and designated on/off buttons is perfect!! Great work on this app.

Review 8: Responsive I like it  I have the easybulb plus flat  and theor app is not compatible with my tablet. So I downloaded this app and it works well  it seems more responsive than the easybulb app and it makes the light brighter since it actually tuens up the brightnes.

Review 9: I like it All its missing is a color chooser in the wear app and the same functionality in the form of a widget then this will be the only lighting controller we would need since it would have it all  compared to competing apps

uk.ac.ed.inf.mandelbrotmaps,Positive,"Review 1: Extremely fast This is probably the fastest Mandelbrot fractal zoomer on the web. The zoom function is much easier to use compared to the other fractal explorers. I also like how easy it is to switch to the Julia set. Plus it's open source and ad-free. There are a few things that could improve it  however. When I try to swipe around to move the view  the Julia pin appears and is distracting. Maybe disable the julia pin from appearing while moving the view. A way to view the coordinates of the julia pin would also be nice.

Review 2: Excellent - and I've some suggestions for making it better! First of all - thank you! Lovely app. And a splendid undergraduate project. The detail is breath taking. It would be even better  tho  if one could have information on the number of iterations being performed. A simple counter would be adequate. Also  an optional grid for the (x y) axes would be helpful.

Review 3: Needs a coordinate system! Really awsome app  fantastic use of touch navigation. Sometimes after I have surfed the Mandelbrot  I find a segment I would like to get a external high resolution image of. A feature in your app that tells the coordinates and zoom would be really handy. Awsome work.

Review 4: minimal doesn't overpromise  works well enough to be fun and informative ... could not find saved images  but that's ok because it can display image without adornment -&gt; screenshot ... adding option to rotate orientation would be nice

Review 5: AMAZING I was just an average person trying to show someone the M-Set online when I discovered this app. Words cannot describe how phenomenal navigating through these maps are! WOW.

Review 6: Great but... I'd give it 5 stars if it had more color control  like xaos for desktops. Also the Julia sets dim when zooming. But very good work...keep at it!

Review 7: Great stuff! Add some coloring algorithms why don't ya? And props for releasing your code - anyone who really takes pride in their work should do so!

uk.org.ngo.squeezer,Negative,"Review 1: I've been using this with a Raspberry PI based music server on my boat. The server has over 38K tracks. While I guess I should expect this system to be slow to update on a large music library  I often find that in the middle of paging through music  the connection to the server is lost and I have to reconnect and start from the beginning again. After 4 or 5 times it can get pretty frustrating. For me  the Logitech Android client works the best (I think it does a better job of caching the music library)  but unfortunately it won't work with Android 5 and above. I've tried some of the others  and they were worse  so it's the best of a bad lot!

Review 2: Good  but needs filtering options Works really well  but is a bit annoying how it lumps in composers  conductors and bands (orchestras) in with the Artists. These are separate fields for a reason  and to lump them all together makes searches longer and annoying. This app needs to allow filtering of what appears in the Artist list. UPDATE: I couldn't stand the endless searching through reams of conductors and composers  etc  so finally took the plunge to buy Squeeze Ctrl. Problem solved. Shame they couldn't fix something so simple  but hey  you get what you pay for  and this is free.

Review 3: Like Original Squeezebox Works well ! The same navigation interface that the Logitech app is welcome. Need to add some menu options in future release like add a song to an existing Playlist from current playing Playlist. More annoying is When I try to launch a search on my Deezer app (artist  song  album search)  I can't enter something. Instead  I got results for the search of """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""QUERY"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" as soon as I choose the category of search... I'm on a Xperia Z1 with Android 5.1.1 Do other people have the same issue ?""""

Review 4: Great option -- especially if you've been abandoned by Logitech. First they kill the squeezebox  then stop updating the Android app. So lame. Only thing missing here for my needs (unless I'm wrong and someone correct me if I am) is the ability to browse library by Album Artist (rather than just Album or just Artist). The """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""official"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Logitech app let me do that  and now it's a habit. If you don't need that view it's a five-star app.""""

Review 5: Scrolling nightmare. I go to Music Folder and then FLAC folder and when I scroll down after 20 or so folders the names disappear as if the app is building the database ... EACH AND EVERY TIME. If you minimize and bring it up and hit back to get back to the artist folder (if you were browsing an album by that artist) it goes back to root folder. Annoying. Other than that  never crashed or gave trouble. Just too sluggish with huge libraries.

Review 6: Decent app - the reason I am going to pay for a different one is simply because you can't control the volume from the app  which is a major omission  and an oft used functionality for me. The other omission is the alphabet as an index to the right of the list of artists so you have to guess about where you are headed in the long list.

Review 7: Good app  annoying notification Now using Squeezer instead of Squeeze Commander which I had been using for the last 3 years. Better looking  more intuitive interface. Does everything you would expect. However  it's very annoying to have to disconnect before quitting (or force-close) in order to get rid of the notification.

Review 8: Worked first time with no problems and quite quick to connect. However  one annoying thing  is that if I play from an album folder it plays them in a random order even though the tracks are numbered. Am I missing a setting? - I couldn't find one.

Review 9: Problem with volume When you adjust volume outside of the app by using the phone's physical volume button or the popup volume controller  the volume reverts back to the level you set in the app's main window when the next track plays. Please fix

Review 10: Lacks essential features I tried this as an alternative to squeeze commander which doesn't seem to be being updated anymore. Initially looked ok but inability to start playing a playlist part way through the list makes it useless to me.",4195,Squeezer is a free app that lets you play music on your phone.

uk.org.ngo.squeezer,Positive,"Review 1: Great app  and top marks to the guys developing and maintaining it. I haven't found where to make comments or request features (the web site and github each seem to link to the other  an endless loop) so here goes. * When LMS is stopped  tapping forward or backward has no effect - is this a design feature or a bug? Forward and back work the same as on LMS web interface when something is playing. * A feature I'd love to have is a list by """"album artist""""  as well as """"artist"""" - I've about got 2.5k album artists but over 18k artists so load time can be quite slow. Still an excellent app  and does what I use most. (Galaxy A5 phone with Android 6; LMS 7.9 on Vortexbox 2.3)

Review 2: Fantastic. This is what the official Logitech SB Touch app should have been. The controls are very responsive. Using the volume buttons to control the squeezebox volume is a no-brainer but why didn't Logitech app designers think of that?

Just press the little triangle beside the song you want to copy and choose """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""download"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""". A widget would be a great enhancement to an already awesome app. Thanks very much for making this great app!""""

Review 3: Almost perfect So far this is the best squeezebox controller I have seen. Since I end up using multiple squeezebox radios as well as squeezeplayer on old cell phones  the ability to easily control them all from one screen is nice. The only problem I have is when my phone or tablet goes to sleep after a minute of non use  the connection to the server is lost  even though it doesn't indicate it from the screen. I have to disconnect and reconnect in order to get it working again. I would like to see a widget controller.

Review 4: Excellent app. Hope it continues to improve. This is a great app. It's user-friendly and is bug-free. I'd like to see one feature added. When you start a album or playlist by tapping a song  play does not continue past that one song. I can work around it but an option for this would be nice. Perhaps there could be a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""play from here"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" option in the song menu or an option in the settings menu to continue playing the rest of an album when a song ends.""""

Review 5: Great app for controlling the Logitech Media Server!!! I have a Squeezebox radio and 2 android devices connected to my LMS. This app allows you to synchronize all of your players or have each of them playing different playlists in different rooms. It allows you to adjust the the volume on each player separately and turn a player on or off while the other players continue. It's easy to operate and works great. A big thank you to the developer!

Review 6: Excellent app; BIGUP the developers. Should be able to operate without connecting to LMS tho  as did the original Logitech app. I often used my sb duet to just stream internet radio (added to favorites). Great to not have to have a computer running but still stream music. You can even take your duet round to your mates house without having to take the computer as well. Any chance?

Review 7: Just gets better and better with time; its perfect integration with Android Wear and the fact that it now seems to never drop out or lose connection is amazing! That being said  now that I've installed Triode's Spotify plugin / the Youtube Plugin it's shortcoming is that it can't do text input fields in either of those things; but for a free app it's still really amazing

Review 8: Nicely done! Different from the Logitech official app (that no longer works on Lollipop) but better in many ways. Loads quickly  easy swipe down access and all the important features. I will second Ben T's request for a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""play from here"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" when browsing songs in an album or playlist. That's the one feature I miss from the official app.""""

Review 9: Good but Good. I have only used it for a short time so far and I am already impressed with how it looks and performs. It took just a few seconds to find my server and music with no input from me. The only thing i have found disappointing is the random song play mode. There doesn't appear to be an option to select the genres to use for the random mode.

us.bravender.android.dongsa,Negative,"Review 1: Not very useful for absolute beginners I am sorry to go against the crowd of five stars but for an absolute beginner the app does not really help. One would need first a list of verbs in English to choose from  and from there get the translation in Hangul with the conjugation and their translation. I join other comments that the font is too small and size cannot be adjusted. With the improvements above the app could be also useful for beginners and I could take advantage of it.

Review 2: This app does not actually look for different verbs. All of the things that you type in will say that the words mean high and low  in different forms of speech  whether formal/informal. This makes me think that the whole make up is for show. Like the example of the vocabulary word searched in the picture example  that is all that ever comes up. XP

Review 3: Great app Its annoying seeing all these bad reviews because its not for beginners its a great app if you are ACTUALLY learning Korean and don't expect the language to be spoonfed to you like a lot of people... &gt;_&gt;

us.bravender.android.dongsa,Positive,"Review 1: App is and does exactly what it says! This app is great  so useful to have all the proper verb conjugations right at my fingertips. A translation of the verbs would be nice  but chances are if you're attempting to conjugate it  you already know what it means. But it does have helpful and accurate pronunciations of those verbs which is 10x more valuable. Honestly I'd give them 5 stars just for not wanting to invade my phone like every other app.

Review 2: This is NOT an app for beginners I love this app. It has saved me more times than I can count. I use it in conjunction with the website since it offers reverse conjugations and the definition of the verbs. I do not recommend this app for beginners. I would recommend at lease an intermediate knowledge of Korean to be able to use it properly.

Review 3: Not very useful for absolute beginners  but... This app is amazing. It's not easy to keep track on all the endings in Korean   but it has helped me out a lot when I had to write down my Korean homework. If you know a lot of words in original form  then this app will be a great tool to help you see the different endings

Review 4: App is sooo useful. Can't count how many times I've wanted something like this for those awkward little irregulars  this seems to nail it. 4 stars because of an annoying graphical glitch when scrolling where the text seems to be in 2 positions at once. Pretty easy to replicate just by scrolling. I'm using a Galaxy S6.

Review 6: Functions ok  but interface is from ancient times It works and displays conjugations just fine. But the interface is from the ancient times of Android Version 1 (!!). We're at version 7 now so maybe it deserves an upgrade to material design 😇

Review 7: Very very useful I've been learning korean and i always get lost with conjugating words like eg. 춥다 becomes 추워 and such like that so thank you very much 👌

Review 3: Used to love this...but I used to seriously love this app but recently I have found that there are certain things it just will not find. I can go to my contacts and search for a name and it comes right up. If I put the same name in quickdroid it never comes up. What's the deal devs?

vu.de.urpool.quickdroid,Positive,"Review 1: One of the best time savers We often times take for granted we will find the application we are looking for but the reality is that we will just waste time swiping back and forth. This application has saved me thousands of seconds that I would have otherwise wasted swiping. Those thousands of seconds would have become months of my life wasted doing nothing  just like it happens when we wait for a video to load or an old PC to boot. This application is a priceless shortcut.

Review 2: Great app launcher Perfect for users of Alfred or Quicksilver. You just open Quickdroid and type in the app you'd like to open. I use this with Nova Launcher and I've set up a double tap on the homescreen which opens Quickdroid. I haven't used my app drawer in months.

Review 3: Hands down my most used apl After my home screen  this is the most used app I have. After having it I shudder to think how I could launch apps anyway else! 10 stars! Just wish there were more updates and more features  a la Linux Zeitgeist

Review 4: First thing I install This has replaced the app drawer for me for anything not important enough to be on my home screen. Having contacts in there is also very convenient.

wb.receiptspro,Negative,"Review 1: Good product Great product but taking photos of receipts on my galaxy s6 edge 5.0.1 is currently buggy. When I take the picture it still acts as if I'm taking a picture so I can't see what it looks like. I have to click the tick finish the receipt entry and then view the image to see if it worked. An annoying process for all my receipt images. Apart from the its a great app and I love the import export feature.

Review 2: I regret buying it. I think it is not user friendly at all so I went to their homepage online for directions and they didn't have them in the user's guide. It tells how to do a couple things then has no information on any additional steps. They say """"sorry info not available"""" basically. It allows you to photograph receipts but doesn't allow true tracking of them.

Review 3: Nice App  but recent versions are buggy. This is a great  simple receipt manager. The only nuisance I've experienced is that newer versions seem to have trouble retaining the distance values for more than a day or two. I track mileage elsewhere so it isn't a deal breaker  as mileage was never the apps best feature.

Review 4: Buggy It was not worth paying the $3 to have an add free version. This one is more buggy than the free version. For example  entering a a receipt for a trip during a particular time span will bring the current date  not the start date of the trip. This is not the case on the free version... :(

Review 5: Getting there... No OCR to auto input fields from receipts. Doesn't let you generate custom receipts. Can't crop pics to cut down on storage. No auto cloud backup. Also  I wish it displayed the trip total when you're within a trip.

Review 6: Not loving it I thought I could sync multiple devices since I carry different ones at times but when I export and try to import I get an error about not recognizing the file as importable. Guess I need to find something else.

Review 7: Please help.!!! I have one years worth of 2016 receipts and this app is frozed up on me. I backed the data up to Google drive. I then uninstalled and reinstalled and imported the data. The data did not show up. Please help

wb.receiptspro,Positive,"Review 1: What makes this app stand out is that it is most secure due to not having an OCR feature. This means that your receipts do not go to a third party for interpretation. If you travel to places like the UAE different shops show differen portions of your CC number  making it easy to glean the whole number with only a few purchases. Manual entry has been mad as simple as possible so this has been Great for a traveling consultant. I can't rave enough.. I dump the cvs table into a speadsheet that automatically uses the data for tailored invoice reporting and for CPA at end of year.. it's sooooo cool. My clients love my invoices (well  the format anyway). And  CPA loves it. I might only suggest one added custom list... as a nice to have.

Review 2: Updated @ 2.5 Months: Easily The Best! After auditioning numerous apps late last year  I'm now at 2.5 months of actual use with Smart Receipts Pro. I'm pleased to report 0 issues! I operate a sole proprietorship  so I need reliable and efficient business tools to save time and hassle. Smart Receipts was the only app that met my needs. Other reviews touting outstanding support were critical in my decision making (and proved to be 100% accurate). Developer has many enhancements on the drawing board  which is important for any app. Go Pro!!

Review 3: Great Receipts Application! Simplifies the process of compiling your receipts into an easy to read PDF report with an optional summary page. The biggest function it lacks is OCR recognition but the developer has stated that's planned for a future release. A feature I would highly recommend is the ability to append a receipt that may be from another image source stored on the phone and not just. From the camera. Another good feature would be the ability to merge a page from an existing PDF document such as airfare receipts. 5 stars.

Review 4: Worth paying for I rarely  rarely spend money on apps because I haven't found many that are worth spending money on. As the sole employee for a small business  I am constantly behind on bookkeeping  partially due to receipts being scattered and multiple account tracking. I'm excited to find this app to help me keep on track  which I'm already doing two weeks into purchasing the app. Would like to see the ability to add multiple photos to a receipt for those purchases that are more then one page or don't fit into one photo.

Review 5: Great App  Super support First time I have ever rated an app. I have never used an app that warranted the effort. This app has changed how I do things. I can now say to my book keeper  here is the gas receipt from last tuesday! I run a small business and paper is my nemesis. But I now have it under control. Thanks to Will for all the support. With his help the app does more then I could have hoped for. If you have trouble keeping your paper organized don't hesitate to purchase this app.

Review 6: A very nice app. Works well. I tried the free version for a week and felt it is a very good application  that handles my needs. I went ahead and purchased the very reasonable ad free version for $2.99. How can you beat that. I am sure the developer has put quite some time into this  since it addresses the need to capture receipts and produce good organized reports. Nice job. I plan on email the developer about date range options  I hope his response is a good as the app.

Review 7: Awesome..great service Wow when I first tried to download it..the app didn't load..so I bought the app and it still didn't load...so I wrote to the maker of this app..he was so helpful...loved that he took the time to make sure I was a happy customer..turned out it was a glitch in the app store that day...next day it downloaded no problems...but was super nice of Will to help like he did..thanks...and anyone who is interested...app is amazing..and so helpful

Review 8: Great app Tried many of the so called expense report apps on Google apps. This is the best one I have found to date. No monthly cost and WiFi required. Customizable in many ways. OCR would be nice and see it is in the works. Only thing that would put this to the 6 star level for me would be a job or possible number field. Understand it can be done in comments but would be nice to have a DB of job or PO numbers to select from. Great job!!

Review 9: Just perfect for me! App does exactly what I need. I capture receipts on the go  and can just throw the paper away.... It took me a while to trust it to that extent  but it has never let me down. No more wallet stuffed with receipts! A bonus would be to auto backup to a cloud service and be able to archive or hide submitted reports though. Still gets 5 stars for making my work travel a breeze. I use it almost every day.
